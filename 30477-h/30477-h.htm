<h3>INTRODUCES A GENTLEMAN.</h3>


<p class="gap2">"<span class="smcap">Then</span> it's an entire mystery?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Phrida."</p>

<p>"But it's astounding! It really seems so utterly
impossible," declared my well-beloved, amazed at
what I had just related.</p>

<p>"I've simply stated hard facts."</p>

<p>"But there's been nothing about this affair in
the papers."</p>

<p>"For certain reasons the authorities are not
exactly anxious for any publicity. It is a very
puzzling problem, and they do not care to own
themselves baffled," I replied.</p>

<p>"Really, it's the most extraordinary story of
London life that I've ever heard," Phrida Shand
declared, leaning forward in her chair, clasping her
small white hands as, with her elbows upon the
<i>table-&agrave;-deux</i>, she looked at me with her wondrous
dark eyes across the bowl of red tulips
between us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>We were lunching together at the Berkeley, in
Piccadilly, one January day last year, and had just
arrived at the dessert.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is quite bewildering, Teddy&mdash;an
utter enigma," she exclaimed in a low, rather
strained voice, her pretty, pointed chin resting upon
the back of her hand as she gazed upon me from
beneath those long, curved lashes.</p>

<p>"I quite agree," was my answer. "The police
are mystified, and so am I. Sir Digby Kemsley is
my friend, you know."</p>

<p>"I remember," she said. "You once introduced
me&mdash;at the opening of the Motor Show at Olympia,
I believe. A very brilliant and famous man,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Rather! A famous engineer. He made the
new railway across the Andes, and possesses huge
rubber interests in Peru. His name, both in Seina
and Valparaiso, is one to conjure with," was my
reply; "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" queried my well-beloved.</p>

<p>"Well, there's one fact which greatly increases
the mystery&mdash;a fact which is yet to be told."</p>

<p>"What's that?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been making inquiries this morning,"
I replied with some reluctance, "and I learn to my
blank amazement that there is no such person as
my friend."</p>

<p>"No such person!" she echoed, staring at me,
her lips parted. Being seated in a corner, no
one could overhear our conversation. "I don't
follow you!"</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Digby died somewhere in South
America about a year ago," was my quiet response.</p>

<p>"What? Was your friend a fraud, eh?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Apparently so. And yet, if he was, he must
have been a man of marvellous cunning and subterfuge,"
I said. "He was most popular at the club,
known at the Ritz and the Savoy, and other places
about town."</p>

<p>"He struck me as a man of great refinement&mdash;a
gentleman, in fact," Phrida said. "I recollect
him perfectly: tall, rather thin, with a pointed, grey
beard, a long, oval face, and thinnish, grey hair. A
very lithe, erect man, whose polite, elegant manner
was that of a diplomat, and in whose dark eyes was
an expression of constant merriment and good
humour. He spoke with a slight accent&mdash;Scotch,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. You remember him perfectly, dear.
A most excellent description," I said; "and that
same description has been circulated this morning
to every police office throughout the United Kingdom,
as well as to the prefectures of police in all
the European capitals. All the ports are being
watched, as it is expected he may make his
way abroad."</p>

<p>"But what do the authorities suspect?" asked
Phrida, with a serious look.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's just it! They haven't yet decided
what to suspect."</p>

<p>I looked across at her and thought, though
slightly more pale than usual, she had never appeared
more charming.</p>

<p>Sweet-faced, slim, with a soft, sibilant voice, and
dainty to her finger-tips, she did not look more
than nineteen, though her age was twenty-four.
How shall I describe her save to say that her oval,
well-defined features were perfect, her dark, arched
brows gave piquancy to a countenance that was
remarked wherever she went, a merry face, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
touch of impudence in her smile&mdash;the face of an
essentially London girl.</p>

<p>Only daughter of my father's late partner, James
Shand, we had been friends from childhood, and our
friendship had, three years ago, blossomed into a
deep and mutual affection. Born and bred in
Kensington, she cared little for country life. She
loved her London, its throbbing streets, its life and
movement, its concerts, its bright restaurants, and,
most of all, its theatres&mdash;for she was an ardent
playgoer.</p>

<p>My father, Edward Royle, was head of the firm of
well-known chemical manufacturers, Messrs. Royle
and Shand, whose works were a feature of the river
landscape close to Greenwich, and whose offices were
in St. Mary Axe. He had died two years before,
pre-deceasing his partner by a year. The business&mdash;a
big one, for we were the largest chemical manufacturers
in England&mdash;had been left solely in my
hands. Shand's widow still lived with Phrida in
Cromwell Road, drawing from it an income of seven
thousand pounds yearly.</p>

<p>As for myself, I was a bachelor, aged thirty-two,
and if golf be a vice I was greatly addicted to it. I
occupied a cosy set of chambers, half-way up Albemarle
Street, and am thankful to say that in consequence
of my father's business acumen, my balance
at my bankers was increasing annually. At the
works at Greenwich nearly two thousand hands were
employed, and it had always been the firm's
proud boast that they laboured under the most
healthy conditions possible to secure in the manufacture
of chemicals.</p>

<p>My father, upon his deathbed, had held my hand
and expressed to me his profoundest satisfaction at
my engagement with the daughter of his partner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and almost with his last breath had pronounced a
blessing upon our union.</p>

<p>Yes, I loved Phrida&mdash;loved her with all my heart
and all my soul. She was mine&mdash;mine for ever.</p>

<p>Yet, as I sat at that little table in the white-enamelled
restaurant gazing at her across the bowl
of tulips, I felt a strange, a very curious misgiving,
an extraordinary misty suspicion, for which I could
not in the least account.</p>

<p>I experienced a strange intuition of doubt and
vague uncertainty.</p>

<p>The facts we had just been discussing were, to
say the least, amazing.</p>

<p>Only the Metropolitan Police and myself were
aware of the astounding discovery which had been
made that morning&mdash;a discovery of which the ever-vigilant
London evening newspapers had as yet
no inkling.</p>

<p>The affair was being carefully hushed up. In
certain quarters&mdash;high official quarters, I believe&mdash;a
flutter of excitement had been caused at noon,
when it had become known that a mystery had
occurred, one which at the outset New Scotland
Yard had acknowledged itself utterly without a clue.</p>

<p>About the affair there was nothing usual, nothing
commonplace. The murder mysteries of London
always form exciting reading, for it is surely the
easiest work of the practised journalist to put
forward from day to day fresh clues and
exciting propositions.</p>

<p>The present case, however, was an entirely fresh
and unheard-of mystery, one such as London had
never before known.</p>

<p>In the whole annals of Scotland Yard no case
presenting such unusual features had previously
been reported.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you no theory as to what really
occurred?" Phrida asked slowly, after a very long
and pensive silence.</p>

<p>"None whatever, dear," I replied.</p>

<p>What theory could I form? Aye, what indeed?</p>

<p>In order that the exact truth should be made
entirely plain to the reader and the mystery viewed
in all its phases, it will be best for me to briefly
record the main facts prior to entering upon
any detail.</p>

<p>The following were the circumstances exactly
as I knew them.</p>

<p>At twenty-five minutes to ten on the previous
night&mdash;the night of January the sixth&mdash;I was at
home in Albemarle Street, writing letters. Haines,
my man, had gone out, and I was alone, when the
telephone bell rang. Taking up the receiver I
heard the cheery voice of Sir Digby Kemsley asking
what I was doing. My prompt reply was that I
was staying at home that night, whereupon his
voice changed and he asked me in great earnestness
to come over to his flat in Harrington Gardens,
South Kensington, at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>"And look here," he added in a confidential
tone, "the outside door will be closed at half-past
ten and the porter off duty. I'll go down just before
eleven and leave the door ajar. Don't let anyone
see you come in. Be extremely careful. I have
reasons I'll explain afterwards."</p>

<p>"Right," I replied, and shut off.</p>

<p>His request seemed just a little curious. It
struck me that he perhaps wished to consult with
me over some private matter, as he had done once
before. Therefore, just before eleven I hailed a
taxi in Piccadilly and drove westward past
Gloucester Road Station, and into the quiet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
eminently select neighbourhood where my friend
lived.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock Harrington Gardens&mdash;that
long thoroughfare of big rather gloomy houses,
most of them residences of City merchants, or
town houses or flats of people who have seats in
the country&mdash;was as silent as the grave, and my
taxi awoke its echoes until, about half way up,
I stopped the man, alighted, and paid him off.</p>

<p>Then, after walking a couple of hundred yards,
I found the door ajar and slipped into the hall
unobserved.</p>

<p>Ascending the wide carpeted steps to the second
floor, the door of the flat was opened noiselessly
by the owner himself, and a few seconds later I
found myself seated before a big fire in his snug
sitting-room.</p>

<p>My friend's face was grey and entirely changed,
yet his manner was still as polished, cheery, and
buoyant as ever.</p>

<p>The flat&mdash;quite a small one, though very expensive
as he had once remarked to me&mdash;was furnished
throughout with elegance and taste. Upon
its walls everywhere hung curios and savage arms,
which he had brought from various parts of the
world. The drawing-room was furnished entirely
in Arab style, with cedar-wood screens, semi-circular
arches, low, soft divans and silken rugs,
which he had bought in Egypt, while, in contrast, the
little den in which we were sitting at that moment
was panelled in white with an old-rose carpet,
rendering it essentially bright and modern.</p>

<p>The tall, grey-bearded, elegant man handed
me a box of Perfectos Finos, from which we selected,
and then, throwing myself into a chair, I slowly
lit up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>His back was turned from me at the moment,
as he leaned over the writing-table apparently
gathering up some papers which he did not desire
that I should see. He was facing a circular mirror
on the wall, and in it I could see his countenance
reflected. The expression upon his face&mdash;cold,
cynical, sinister&mdash;startled me. He placed the papers
in a drawer and locked it with a key upon his
chain.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked. "Why all this confounded
mystery, Digby?"</p>

<p>He turned upon me quickly, his long face
usually so full of merriment, grey and drawn.
I saw instantly that something very serious was
amiss.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I want to ask your advice, Royle," he
replied in a hard voice scarce above a whisper.
Walking to the pretty rug of old-rose and pale green
silk spread before the fire he stood upon it, facing
me. "And&mdash;well, truth to tell, I don't want it
to be known that you've been here to-night, old
fellow."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"For certain private reasons&mdash;very strong
reasons."</p>

<p>"As you wish, my dear chap," was my response,
as I drew at his perfect cigar.</p>

<p>Then he looked me straight in the face and said:
"My motive in asking you here to-night, Royle, is
to beg of you to extend your valued friendship
to me at a moment which is the greatest crisis of
my career. The fact is, I've played the game of life
falsely, and the truth must out, unless&mdash;unless you
will consent to save me."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," I said, staring at him.
"What in heaven's name do you mean?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear boy, I'll put my cards down on the
table at once," he said in a slow, deep tone. "Let's
see&mdash;we've known each other for nearly a year.
You have been my best friend, entirely devoted to
my interests&mdash;a staunch friend, better than whom
no man could ever desire. In return I've lied to you,
led you to believe that I am what I am not. Why?
Because&mdash;well, I suppose I'm no different to any
other man&mdash;or woman for the matter of that&mdash;I
have a skeleton in my cupboard&mdash;a grim skeleton,
my dear Royle. One which I've always striven to
hide&mdash;until to-night," he added with emotion.</p>

<p>"But that hardly interferes with our friendship,
does it? We all of us have our private affairs, both
of business and of heart," I said.</p>

<p>"The heart," he echoed bitterly. "Ah! yes&mdash;the
heart. You, my dear boy, are a man of the
world. You understand life. You are never narrow-minded&mdash;eh?"
he asked, advancing a step nearer
to me.</p>

<p>"I hope not," I said. "At any rate, I've
always been your friend, ever since our first
meeting on the steamer on the Lake of Garda, last
February."</p>

<p>The eminent engineer rolled his cigar between
his fingers, and calmly contemplated it in silence.</p>

<p>Then, quite abruptly, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Royle, my present misfortune is due to a
woman."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I sighed. "A woman! Always a woman
in such cases! Well?"</p>

<p>"Mind you, I don't blame her in the least," he
went on quickly, "I&mdash;I was hot-tempered, and I
miscalculated her power. We quarrelled, and&mdash;and
she, though so young, refined and pretty, has
arisen to crush me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyone I know?"</p>

<p>"No. I think not," was his slow reply, his
dark eyes gazing full into mine as he still stood
astride upon the hearthrug.</p>

<p>Then he fidgeted uneasily, stroked his well-clipped
grey beard with his strong, bronzed hand,
and strode across the room and back again.</p>

<p>"Look here, Royle," he exclaimed at last.
"You're my friend, so I may as well speak straight
out. Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;if I can."</p>

<p>"I'm in a hole&mdash;a confounded hole. I've been
worried ever since I got back from Egypt just
before Christmas. Only you can save me."</p>

<p>"Me! Why?"</p>

<p>"I want you to remain my friend; to still believe
in me, when&mdash;well&mdash;when I've gone under,"
he answered brokenly, his brows contracting as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll speak more plainly. To-night is the
last time we shall meet. I've played the game, I
tell you&mdash;and I've lost!"</p>

<p>"You seem horribly hipped about something
to-night, my dear fellow!" I exclaimed in wonder at
his strange words. In all my circle of friends no
man was more level-headed than Sir Digby
Kemsley.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm not quite myself. Perhaps you
wouldn't be, Royle, in the same circumstances."
Halting, he stood erect with his hands clasped
behind his back. Even then, at that moment
of despair, he presented the fine figure of a man in
his well-cut dinner clothes and the single ruby in
his piqu&eacute; shirt-front. "I want to entrust a secret
to you&mdash;a great secret," he went on a few seconds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
later. "I tell you that to-night is the last occasion
we shall ever meet, but I beg&mdash;may I implore you
to judge me with leniency, to form no unjust conclusions,
and when you remember me to regard my
memory as that of a man who was not a rogue,
but a victim of untoward circumstances."</p>

<p>"Really, my dear fellow," I said, "you speak
in enigmas. What do you mean&mdash;you intend
what?"</p>

<p>"That matters nothing to you, Royle," was his
hoarse reply. "I merely ask for your continued
friendship. I ask that you will treat my successor
here in the exact manner in which you have treated
me&mdash;that you will become his firm friend&mdash;and that
you will perform for me one great and most
important service."</p>

<p>"Your successor! Who will succeed you? You
have no son!"</p>

<p>"No, I have no male relation whatever," he
replied. "But we were speaking of the favour I am
begging of you to perform for me. On the fourteenth
of January I shall not be here, but it is
highly necessary that on that evening, at eight
o'clock, a secret message should be delivered into
the hands of a certain lady&mdash;a message from myself.
Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Are you going abroad again?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, I can hardly tell. I may be dead by
then&mdash;who knows?" And he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>He returned to his writing-table, unlocked a
drawer, and took therefrom a letter which was
carefully sealed with black wax.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," he said, holding the letter in his
fingers; "on the night of the fourteenth, just at
eight o'clock precisely, go to the Piccadilly tube
station, stand at the telephone box numbered four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
on the Haymarket side, when a lady in black will
approach you and ask news of me. In response
you will give her this note. But there is a further
condition: you may be watched and recognised,
therefore be extremely careful that you are not
followed on that day, and, above all, adopt some
effective disguise. Go there dressed as a working-man,
I would suggest."</p>

<p>"That request, Kemsley, is certainly a very queer
one," I remarked. "Is she <i>the</i> lady?"</p>

<p>He smiled, and I took that as an affirmative.</p>

<p>"You say she'll be dressed in black. Lots of
ladies dress in black. I might mistake her."</p>

<p>"Not very likely. I forgot to tell you that she
will wear a small spray of mimosa."</p>

<p>"Ah, that shows originality," I remarked.
"Mimosa is not often worn on the person."</p>

<p>"It will serve as a distinguishing mark." Then,
after a pause, he added, handing me the letter:
"There is one further request I want to make&mdash;or,
at least, I want you to give me your promise, Royle.
I ask you to make a solemn vow to me that if any
suspicion arises within your mind, that you will
believe nothing without absolute and decisive proof.
I mean that you will not misjudge her."</p>

<p>"I certainly will not."</p>

<p>"Your hand upon it?"</p>

<p>I put forth my hand and, gripping his warmly,
gave him my word of honour.</p>

<p>"I hope you will never regret this, Royle," he
said in an earnest tone.</p>

<p>"We are friends," I remarked simply.</p>

<p>"And I trust, Royle, you will never regret the
responsibility which you have accepted on my
behalf," he said in a deep, hard voice&mdash;the voice of
a desperate man. "Remember to treat my successor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
exactly as you have treated me. Be his best friend,
as he will be yours. You will be astonished, amazed,
mystified, no doubt, at the events which must, alas!
inevitably occur. But it is not my fault, Royle,
believe me," he declared with solemn emphasis.
"It is, alas! my misfortune!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE SCENT.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">After</span> giving me the letter, and receiving my
assurance that it would be safely delivered, Sir
Digby's spirits seemed somewhat to revive.</p>

<p>He chatted in his old, good-humoured style, drank
a whisky and soda, and, just before one o'clock,
let me out, urging me to descend the stairs noiselessly
lest the hall-porter should know that he had had
a visitor.</p>

<p>Time after time I had questioned him regarding
his strange reference to his successor, but to all
my queries he was entirely dumb. He had, I
recollected, never been the same since his return
from a flying visit to Egypt.</p>

<p>"The future will, no doubt, astound you,
but I know, Royle, that you are a man of honour
and of your word, and that you will keep
your promise at all hazards," was all he would
reply.</p>

<p>The secrecy with which I had entered and left
caused me considerable curiosity. Kemsley was
one of those free, bluff, open-hearted, open-handed,
men. He was never secretive, never elusive. I
could only account for his curious, mystifying actions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by the fact that the reputation of a woman was
at stake&mdash;that he was acting for her protection.</p>

<p>And I was to meet that woman face to face in
eight days' time!</p>

<p>As I walked towards Gloucester Road Station&mdash;where
I hoped to find a taxi&mdash;all was silence. At
that hour the streets of South Kensington are as
deserted as a graveyard, and as I bent towards the
cutting wind from the east, I wondered who
could be the mysterious woman who had broken
up my dear friend's future plans. Yet he bore
her no malice. Some men's temperaments are
really curious.</p>

<p>Beneath a street-lamp I paused and looked at
the superscription upon the envelope. It ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For E. P. K."</p></div>

<p>The initial K! Was the lady Digby's wife?
That was the suspicion which at once fell upon me,
and by which I became convinced.</p>

<p>At half-past one o'clock I let myself into my
own flat in Albemarle Street. The faithful
Haines, who had been a marine wardroom servant
in the navy before entering my employ, was
awaiting me.</p>

<p>"The telephone bell rang ten minutes ago, sir,"
he said. "Sir Digby Kemsley wishes to speak to
you."</p>

<p>"Very well!" I replied. "You can go to
bed."</p>

<p>The man placed my tray with whisky and soda
upon the little table near my chair, as was his habit,
and, wishing me good-night, retired.</p>

<p>I went to the telephone, and asked for Digby's
number.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few seconds a voice, which at first I failed
to recognise, replied to mine:</p>

<p>"I say, Royle; I'm so sorry to disturb you,
old chap, but could you possibly come back
here at once?"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, very surprised. "Is it
so very important? Can't it wait till to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, unfortunately it can't. It's most imperative
that I should see you. Something has happened.
Do come!" he begged. "But don't attract
attention&mdash;you understand!"</p>

<p>"Something happened!" I echoed. "What?"</p>

<p>"That woman. Come at once&mdash;do, there's
a good fellow. Will you&mdash;for my sake and
hers?"</p>

<p>The mention of the woman decided me, so
I replied "All right!" and hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>Within half an hour I alighted in Courtfield
Gardens and walked up Harrington Gardens to the
door of my friend's house, which I saw was already
ajar in anticipation of my arrival.</p>

<p>Closing the door noiselessly, in order not to
attract the attention of the alert porter who
lived in the basement, I crept up the carpeted
stairs to the door of the flat, which I found also
ajar.</p>

<p>Having closed the door, I slipped into the hall and
made my way to the warm, cosy room I had left
earlier that night.</p>

<p>The door was closed, and without ceremony I
turned the handle.</p>

<p>I threw it open laughingly in order to surprise
my friend, but next instant halted in amazement
upon the threshold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>I stood there breathless, staring in speechless
wonder, and drawing back.</p>

<p>"I'm really very sorry!" I exclaimed. "I
thought Sir Digby was here!"</p>

<p>The man who had risen from his chair and bowed
when I opened the door was about the same build,
but, apparently, a trifle younger. He had iron-grey
hair and a pointed beard, but his face was
more triangular, with higher cheek-bones, and eyes
more brilliant and deeper set.</p>

<p>His thin countenance relaxed into a pleasant
smile as he replied in a calm, suave voice:</p>

<p>"I am Sir Digby Kemsley, and you&mdash;I believe&mdash;are
Mr. Edward Royle&mdash;my friend&mdash;my very
intimate friend&mdash;are you not?"</p>

<p>"You!" I gasped, staring at him.</p>

<p>And then, for several seconds I failed to articulate
any further words. The imposture was so
utterly barefaced.</p>

<p>"You are not Sir Digby Kemsley," I went on
angrily at last. "What trick is this?"</p>

<p>"No trick whatever, my dear Royle," was the
man's quiet reply as he stood upon the hearthrug
in the same position in which my friend had stood
an hour before. "I tell you that my name is
Kemsley&mdash;Sir Digby Kemsley."</p>

<p>"Then you assert that this flat is yours?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly I do."</p>

<p>"Bosh! How can you expect me to believe
such a transparent tale?" I cried impatiently.
"Where is my friend?"</p>

<p>"I am your friend, my dear Royle!" he
laughed.</p>

<p>"You're not."</p>

<p>"But did you not, only an hour ago, promise
him to treat his successor in the same manner in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
which you had treated himself?" the man
asked very slowly, his high, deep-set eyes fixed
upon me with a crafty, almost snake-like expression,
an expression that was distinctly one
of evil.</p>

<p>"True, I did," was my quick reply. "But
I never bargained for this attempted imposture."</p>

<p>"I tell you it is no imposture!" declared the
man before me. "You will, perhaps, understand
later. Have a cigar," and he took up Digby's
box and handed it to me.</p>

<p>I declined very abruptly, and without much
politeness, I fear.</p>

<p>I was surveying the man who, with such astounding
impudence, was attempting to impose
upon me a false identity. There was something
curiously striking in his appearance, but what it
was I could not exactly determine. His speech
was soft and educated, in a slightly higher pitch
than my friend's; his hands white and carefully
manicured, yet, as he stood, I noted that his left
shoulder was slightly higher than the other, that
his dress clothes ill-fitted him in consequence; that
in his shirt-front were two rare, orange-coloured
gems such as I had never seen before, and, further,
that when I caught him side face, it much resembled
Digby's, so aquiline as to present an almost
birdlike appearance.</p>

<p>"Look here!" I exclaimed in anger a few
moments later. "Why have you called me over
here? When you spoke to me your voice struck
me as peculiar, but I put it down to the distortion
of sound on the telephone."</p>

<p>"I wanted to see if you recognised my other
self," he answered with a smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"At this late hour? Couldn't you have postponed
your ghastly joke till the morning?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Joke!" he echoed, his face suddenly pale
and serious. "This is no joke, Royle, but a very
serious matter. The most serious that can occur
in any man's life."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it? Tell me the truth."</p>

<p>"You shall know that later."</p>

<p>"Where is Sir Digby?"</p>

<p>"Here! I am Sir Digby, I tell you."</p>

<p>"I mean my friend."</p>

<p>"I am your friend," was the man's response,
as he turned away towards the writing-table.
"The friend you first met on the Lake of
Garda."</p>

<p>"Now, why all this secrecy?" I asked. "I
was first called here and warned not to show myself,
and, on arrival, find you here."</p>

<p>"And who else did you expect to find?" he
asked with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"I expected to find my friend."</p>

<p>"But I am your friend," he asserted. "You
promised me only an hour ago that you would
treat my successor exactly as you treated me.
And," he added, "I am my own successor!"</p>

<p>I stood much puzzled.</p>

<p>There were certain features in his countenance
that were much like Digby's, and certain
tones in his voice that were the same. His hands
seemed the same, too, and yet he was not Digby
himself.</p>

<p>"How can I believe you if you refuse to be frank
and open with me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You promised me, Royle, and a good deal
depends upon your promise," he replied, looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
me squarely in the face. "Perhaps even your
own future."</p>

<p>"My future!" I echoed. "What has that to
do with you, pray?" I demanded angrily.</p>

<p>"More than you imagine," was his low response,
his eyes fixed upon mine.</p>

<p>"Well, all I know is that you are endeavouring
to make me believe that you are what you are not.
Some evil purpose is, no doubt, behind it all. But
such an endeavour is an insult to my intelligence,"
I declared.</p>

<p>The man laughed a low, harsh laugh and turned
away.</p>

<p>"I demand to know where my friend is!" I cried,
stepping after him across the room, and facing
him again.</p>

<p>"My dear Royle," he replied, in that curious,
high-pitched voice, yet with a calm, irritating
demeanour. "Haven't I already told you I am
your friend?"</p>

<p>"It's a lie! You are not Sir Digby!" I cried
angrily. "I shall inform the police that I've
found you usurping his place and name, and leave
them to solve the mystery."</p>

<p>"Act just as you think fit, my dear old fellow,"
he laughed. "Perhaps the police might discover
more than you yourself would care for them to
know."</p>

<p>His words caused me to ponder. At what could
he be hinting?</p>

<p>He saw my hesitancy, and with a sudden movement
placed his face close to me, saying:</p>

<p>"My dear fellow look&mdash;look into my countenance,
you surely can penetrate my disguise. It cannot
be so very perfect, surely."</p>

<p>I looked, but turned from him in disgust.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. Stop this infernal fooling!" I cried.
"I've never seen you before in my life."</p>

<p>He burst out laughing&mdash;laughed heartily, and
with genuine amusement.</p>

<p>His attitude held me in surprise.</p>

<p>"You refuse to be my friend, Royle&mdash;but
I desire to be yours, if you will allow me," he
said.</p>

<p>"I can have no friend whom I cannot trust,"
I repeated.</p>

<p>"Naturally. But I hope you will soon learn
to trust me," was his quiet retort. "I called you
back to-night in order to see if you&mdash;my most
intimate friend&mdash;would recognise me. But you do
not. I am, therefore, safe&mdash;safe to go forth and
perform a certain mission which it is imperative
that I should perform."</p>

<p>"You are fooling me," I declared.</p>

<p>For a second he looked straight and unflinchingly
into my eyes, then with a sudden movement
he drew the left cuff of his dress shirt up to
the elbow and held out his forearm for me to
gaze upon.</p>

<p>I looked.</p>

<p>Then I stood dumbfounded, for half-way up
the forearm, on the inside, was the cicatrice of
an old knife wound which long ago, he had told
me, had been made by an Indian in South America
who had attempted to kill him, and whom he had
shot in self-defence.</p>

<p>"You believe me now?" he asked, in a voice
scarce above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Of course," I said. "Pardon me, Digby&mdash;but
this change in your personality is marvellous&mdash;almost
superhuman!"</p>

<p>"So I've been told before," he replied lightly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, really, didn't you penetrate it?" he asked,
resuming his normal voice.</p>

<p>"No. I certainly did not," I answered, and
helping myself to a drink, swallowed it.</p>

<p>"Well?" I went on. "What does this
mean?"</p>

<p>"At present I can't exactly tell you what I
intend doing," he replied. "To-night I wanted to
test you, and have done so. It's late now," he
added, glancing at the clock, which showed it to be
half-past two o'clock in the morning. "Come in
to-morrow at ten, will you?" he asked. "I want
to discuss the future with you very seriously. I
have something to say which concerns your own
future, and which also closely concerns a friend
of yours. So come in your own interests, Royle&mdash;now
don't fail, I beg of you!"</p>

<p>"But can't you tell me to-night," I asked.</p>

<p>"Not until I know something of what my own
movements are to be," he replied. "I cannot
know before to-morrow," he replied with a mysterious
air. "So if you wish to be forewarned of an
impending peril, come and see me and I will then
explain. We shall, no doubt, be on closer terms
to-morrow. <i>Au revoir</i>," and he took my hand
warmly and then let me out.</p>

<p>The rather narrow, ill-lit staircase, the outer
door of which had been shut for hours, was close and
stuffy, but as I descended the second flight and
was about to pass along the hall to the door, I distinctly
heard a movement in the shadow where,
on my left, the hall continued along to the door
of the ground-floor flat.</p>

<p>I peered over the banisters, but in the darkness
could distinguish nothing.</p>

<p>That somebody was lurking there I instantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
felt assured, and next moment the truth became
revealed by two facts.</p>

<p>The first was a light, almost imperceptible noise,
the jingle of a woman's bangles, and, secondly,
the faint odour of some subtle perfume, a sweet,
intoxicating scent such as my nostrils had never
greeted before.</p>

<p>For the moment I felt surprise, but as the hidden
lady was apparently standing outside the ground-floor
flat&mdash;perhaps awaiting admittance&mdash;I felt it
to be no concern of mine, and proceeding, opened
the outer door and passed outside, closing it quietly
after me.</p>

<p>An unusually sweet perfume one can seldom
forget. Even out in the keen night air that delightful
odour seemed to cling to my memory&mdash;the
latest creation of the Rue de la Paix, I
supposed.</p>

<p>Well, I duly returned home to Albemarle Street
once again, utterly mystified.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Why had Digby
adopted such a marvellous disguise? What
did he mean by saying that he wished to
stand my friend and safeguard me from impending
evil?</p>

<p>Yes, it was all a mystery&mdash;but surely not so
great a mystery as that which was to follow. Ah!
had I but suspected the astounding truth how very
differently would I have acted!</p>

<p>Filled with curiosity regarding Digby's strange
forebodings, I alighted from a taxi in Harrington
Gardens at a quarter to eleven that same morning,
but on entering found the uniformed hall-porter
in a great state of excitement and alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" he cried breathlessly, advancing
towards me. "You're a friend of Sir Digby's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sir. The police are upstairs. Something extraordinary
has happened."</p>

<p>"The police!" I gasped. "Why, what's happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir. As his man left the day before yesterday,
my wife went up to Sir Digby's flat as usual
this morning about eight, and put him his early
cup of tea outside his door. But when she went
in again she found he had not taken it into his room.
She believed him to be asleep, so not till ten o'clock
did she go into the sitting-room to draw up the
blinds, when, to her horror, she found a young
lady, a perfect stranger, lying stretched on the
floor there! She rushed down and told me, and
I went up. I found that Sir Digby's bed hadn't
been slept in, and that though the poor girl was
unconscious, she was still breathing. So I at once
called in the constable on point duty at the corner
of Collingham Road, and he 'phoned to the police
station."</p>

<p>"But the girl&mdash;is she dead?" I inquired
quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. You'd better go upstairs.
There's an inspector, two plain-clothes men, and a
doctor up there."</p>

<p>He took me up in the lift, and a few moments
later I stood beside Digby's bed, whereon the men
had laid the inanimate form of a well-dressed girl
whom I judged to be about twenty-two, whose dark
hair, unbound, lay in disorder upon the pillow.
The face, white as marble, was handsome and
clean cut, but upon it, alas! was the ashen hue
of death, the pale lips slightly parted as though in
a half-sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>The doctor was bending over her making his
examination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked upon her for a moment, but it was a
countenance which I had never seen before. Digby
had many lady friends, but I had never seen her
among them. She was a perfect stranger.</p>

<p>Her gown was of dark blue serge, smartly made,
and beneath her coat she wore a cream silk blouse
with deep sailor collar open at the neck, and a soft
flowing bow of turquoise blue. This, however, had
been disarranged by the doctor in opening her
blouse to listen to her breathing, and I saw that
upon it was a small crimson stain.</p>

<p>Yes, she was remarkably good-looking, without
a doubt.</p>

<p>When I announced myself as an intimate friend
of Sir Digby Kemsley, the inspector at once took
me into the adjoining room and began to eagerly
question me.</p>

<p>With him I was perfectly frank; but I said
nothing regarding my second visit there in the
night.</p>

<p>My gravest concern was the whereabouts of my
friend.</p>

<p>"This is a very curious case, Mr. Royle,"
declared the inspector. "The C.I.D. men have
established one fact&mdash;that another woman was with
the stranger here in the early hours of this morning.
This hair-comb"&mdash;and he showed me a small
side-comb of dark green horn&mdash;"was found close
beside her on the floor. Also a couple of hair-pins,
which are different to those in the dead woman's
hair. There was a struggle, no doubt, and the
woman got away. In the poor girl's hair are two
tortoiseshell side-combs."</p>

<p>"But what is her injury?" I asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"She's been stabbed," he replied. "Let's go
back."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Together we re-entered the room, but as we did
so we saw that the doctor had now left the
bedside, and was speaking earnestly with the two
detectives.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor?" asked the inspector in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"She's quite dead&mdash;murder, without a doubt,"
was his reply. "The girl was struck beneath
the left breast&mdash;a small punctured wound, but
fatal!"</p>

<p>"The woman who left this hair-comb behind
knows something about the affair evidently,"
exclaimed the inspector. "We must first discover
Sir Digby Kemsley. He seems to have been
here up until eleven o'clock last night. Then he
mysteriously disappeared, and the stranger
entered unseen, two very curious and suspicious
circumstances. I wonder who the poor girl
was?"</p>

<p>The two detectives were discussing the affair in
low voices. Here was a complete and very remarkable
mystery, which, from the first, the police
told me they intended to keep to themselves, and
not allow a syllable of it to leak out to the public
through the newspapers.</p>

<p>A woman had been there!</p>

<p>Did there not exist vividly in my recollection
that strange encounter in the darkness of the stairs?
The jingle of the golden bangles, and the sweet odour
of that delicious perfume?</p>

<p>But I said nothing. I intended that the police
should prosecute their inquiries, find my friend, and
establish the identity of the mysterious girl who had
met with such an untimely end presumably at the
hands of that woman who had been lurking in the
darkness awaiting my departure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly it was a mystery, a most remarkable problem
among the many which occur each week amid the
amazing labyrinth of humanity which we term
London life.</p>

<p>Sir Digby Kemsley had disappeared. Where?</p>

<p>Half an hour after noon I had left Harrington
Gardens utterly bewildered, and returned to
Albemarle Street, and at half-past one met Phrida
at the Berkeley, where, as I have already
described, we lunched together.</p>

<p>I had revealed to her everything under seal
of the secrecy placed upon me by the police&mdash;everything
save that suspicion I had had in the
darkness, and the suspicion the police also held&mdash;the
suspicion of a woman.</p>

<p>Relation of the curious affair seemed to have
unnerved her. She had become paler and was
fidgeting with her serviette. Loving me so devotedly,
she seemed to entertain vague and ridiculous
fears regarding my own personal safety.</p>

<p>"It was very foolish and hazardous of you to
have returned there at that hour, dear," she declared
with sweet solicitation, as she drew on her white
gloves preparatory to leaving the restaurant,
for I had already paid the bill and drained my
liqueur-glass.</p>

<p>"I don't see why," I said. "Whatever could
have happened to me, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My sentence remained unfinished.</p>

<p>I held my breath. The colour must have left my
cheeks, I know.</p>

<p>My well-beloved had at that moment opened
her handbag and taken out her wisp of lace
handkerchief.</p>

<p>My nostrils were instantly filled with that same
sweet, subtle perfume which I so vividly recollected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the identical perfume of the woman concealed in
that dark passage-way!</p>

<p>Her bangles, two thin gold ones, jingled as she
moved&mdash;that same sound which had come up to
me from the blackness. I sat like a statue, staring
at her amazed, aghast, like a man in a dream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>DESCRIBES THE TRYSTING-PLACE.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">I drove</span> Phrida back to Cromwell Road in a taxi.</p>

<p>As I sat beside her, that sweet irritating perfume
filled my senses, almost intoxicating me. For
some time I remained silent; then, unable to
longer restrain my curiosity, I exclaimed with a
calm, irresponsible air, though with great difficulty
of self-restraint:</p>

<p>"What awfully nice perfume you have, dearest!
Surely it's new, isn't it? I never remember smelling
it before!"</p>

<p>"Quite new, and rather delicious, don't you
think? My cousin Arthur brought it from Paris
a few days ago. I only opened the bottle last night.
Mother declared it to be the sweetest she's ever
smelt. It's so very strong that one single drop is
sufficient."</p>

<p>"What do they call it?"</p>

<p>"Parfait d'Amour. Lauzan, in the Plac&eacute; Vend&ocirc;me,
makes it. It's quite new, and not yet on the market,
Arthur said. He got it&mdash;a sample bottle&mdash;from a
friend of his in the perfume trade."</p>

<p>Not on the market! Those words of hers con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>demned
her. Little did she dream that I had
smelt that same sweet, subtle odour as I descended
the stairs from Sir Digby's flat. She, no doubt, had
recognised my silhouette in the half darkness, yet
nevertheless she felt herself quite safe, knowing
that I had not seen her.</p>

<p>Why had she been lurking there?</p>

<p>A black cloud of suspicion fell upon me. She
kept up a desultory conversation as we went along
Piccadilly in the dreary gloom of that dull January
afternoon, but I only replied in monosyllables, until
at length she remarked:</p>

<p>"Really, Teddy, you're not thinking of a word
I'm saying. I suppose your mind is centred upon
your friend&mdash;the man who has turned out to be an
impostor."</p>

<p>The conclusion of that sentence and its tone
showed a distinct antagonism.</p>

<p>It was true that the man whom I had known
as Sir Digby Kemsley&mdash;the man who for years past
had been so popular among a really good set in
London&mdash;was according to the police an impostor.</p>

<p>The detective-inspector had told me so. From the
flat in Harrington Gardens the men of the Criminal
Investigation Department had rung up New Scotland
Yard to make their report, and about noon, while I
was resting at home in Albemarle Street, I was told
over the telephone that my whilom friend was not
the man I had believed him to be.</p>

<p>As I had listened to the inspector's voice, I heard
him say:</p>

<p>"There's another complication of this affair,
Mr. Royle. Your friend could not have been Sir
Digby Kemsley, for that gentleman died suddenly
a year ago, at Huacho, in Peru. There was some
mystery about his death, it seems, for it was reported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
by the British Consul at Lima. Inspector Edwards,
of the C.I. Department, will call upon you this
afternoon. What time could you conveniently
be at home?"</p>

<p>I named five o'clock, and that appointment
I intended, at all hazards, to keep.</p>

<p>The big, heavily-furnished drawing-room in
Cromwell Road was dark and sombre as I stood with
Phrida, who, bright and happy, pulled off her
gloves and declared to her mother&mdash;that charming,
sedate, grey-haired, but wonderfully preserved,
woman&mdash;that she had had such "a jolly lunch."</p>

<p>"I saw the Redmaynes there, mother," she was
saying. "Mr. Redmayne has asked us to lunch
with them at the Carlton next Tuesday. Can
we go?"</p>

<p>"I think so, dear," was her mother's reply.
"I'll look at my engagements."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let's go! Ida is coming home from
her trip to the West Indies. I do want to see
her so much."</p>

<p>Strange it was that my well-beloved, in face of that
amazing mystery, preserved such an extraordinary,
nay, an astounding, calm. I was thinking of the
little side-comb of green horn, for I had seen her
wearing a pair exactly similar!</p>

<p>Standing by I watched her pale sweet countenance,
full of speechless wonder.</p>

<p>After the first moment of suspense she had found
herself treading firm ground, and now, feeling herself
perfectly secure, she had assumed a perfectly frank
and confident attitude.</p>

<p>Yet the perfume still arose to my nostrils&mdash;the
sweet, subtle scent which had condemned her.</p>

<p>I briefly related to Mrs. Shand my amazing adventures
of the previous night, my eyes furtively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
upon Phrida's countenance the while. Strangely
enough, she betrayed no guilty knowledge, but fell
to discussing the mystery with ease and common-sense
calm.</p>

<p>"What I can't really make out is how your
friend could have had the audacity to pose as Sir
Digby Kemsley, well knowing that the real person
was alive," she remarked.</p>

<p>"The police have discovered that Sir Digby died
in Peru last January," I said.</p>

<p>"While your friend was in London?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. My friend&mdash;I shall still call him
Sir Digby, for I have known him by no other name&mdash;has
not been abroad since last July, when he went
on business to Moscow."</p>

<p>"How very extraordinary," remarked Mrs. Shand.
"Your friend must surely have had some object in
posing as the dead man."</p>

<p>"But he posed as a man who was still alive!"
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Until, perhaps, he was found out," observed
Phrida shrewdly. "Then he bolted."</p>

<p>I glanced at her quickly. Did those words betray
any knowledge of the truth, I wondered.</p>

<p>"Apparently there was some mystery surrounding
the death of Sir Digby at Huacho," I remarked.
"The British Consul in Lima made a report upon it
to the Foreign Office, who, in turn, handed it to
Scotland Yard. I wonder what it was."</p>

<p>"When you know, we shall be better able to
judge the matter and to form some theory," Phrida
said, crossing the room and re-arranging the big
bowl of daffodils in the window.</p>

<p>I remained about an hour, and then, amazed
at the calmness of my well-beloved, I returned
to my rooms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>In impatience I waited till a quarter past five,
when Haines ushered in a tall, well-dressed, clean-shaven
man, wearing a dark grey overcoat and white
slip beneath his waistcoat, and who introduced
himself as Inspector Charles Edwards.</p>

<p>"I've called, Mr. Royle, in order to make some
further inquiries regarding this person you have
known as Sir Digby Kemsley," he said when he had
seated himself. "A very curious affair happened
last night. I've been down to Harrington Gardens,
and have had a look around there myself. Many
features of the affair are unique."</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed. "It is curious&mdash;very curious."</p>

<p>"I have a copy of your statement regarding your
visit to the house during the night," said the
official, who was one of the Council of Seven at the
Yard, looking up at me suddenly from the cigarette
he was about to light. "Have you any suspicion
who killed the young lady?"</p>

<p>"How can I have&mdash;except that my friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is missing&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"But now, tell me all about this friend whom you
knew as Sir Digby Kemsley. How did you first
become acquainted with him?"</p>

<p>"I met him on a steamer on the Lake of Garda
this last summer," was my reply. "I was staying
at Riva, the little town at the north end of the
lake, over the Austrian frontier, and one day took
the steamer down to Gardone, in Italy. We sat
next each other at lunch on board, and, owing to a
chance conversation, became friends."</p>

<p>"What did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"Well, only that he was travelling for his health.
He mentioned that he had been a great deal in
South America, and was then over in Europe for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
holiday. Indeed, on the first day we met, he did
not even mention his name, and I quite forgot to
ask for it. In travelling one meets so many people
who are only of brief passing interest. It was not
until a week later, when I found him staying in the
same hotel as myself, the Cavour, in Milan, I learnt
from the hall-porter that he was Sir Digby Kemsley,
the great engineer. We travelled to Florence
together, and stayed at the Baglioni, but one
morning when I came down I found a hurried note
awaiting me. From the hall-porter I learned that
a gentleman had arrived in the middle of the night,
and Sir Digby, after an excited controversy, left
with him for London. In the note he gave me his
address in Harrington Gardens, and asked me not
to fail to call on my return to town."</p>

<p>"Curious to have a visitor in the middle of the
night," remarked the detective reflectively.</p>

<p>"I thought so at the time, but, knowing him to
be a man of wide business interests, concluded that
it was someone who had brought him an urgent
message," I replied. "Well, the rest is quickly
told. On my return home I sought him out, with
the result that we became great friends."</p>

<p>"You had no suspicion that he was an impostor?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. He seemed well known in
London," I replied. "Besides, if he was not the
real Sir Digby, how is it possible that he could have
so completely deceived his friends! Why, he has
visited the offices of Colliers, the great railway
contractors in Westminster&mdash;the firm who constructed
the railway in Peru. I recollect calling
there with him in a taxi one day."</p>

<p>Edwards smiled.</p>

<p>"He probably did that to impress you, sir," he
replied. "They may have known him as somebody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
else. Or he simply went in and made an inquiry.
He's evidently a very clever person."</p>

<p>Personally, I could not see how my friend could
possibly have posed as Sir Digby Kemsley if he
were not, even though Edwards pointed out that
the real Sir Digby had only been in London a
fortnight for the past nine years.</p>

<p>Still, on viewing the whole situation, I confess
inclination towards the belief that my friend was,
notwithstanding the allegations, the real Sir Digby.</p>

<p>And yet those strange words of his, spoken in such
confidence on the previous night, recurred to me.
There was mystery somewhere&mdash;a far more obscure
mystery even than what was apparent at that
moment.</p>

<p>"Tell me what is known concerning Sir Digby's
death in Peru," I asked.</p>

<p>"From the report furnished to us at the Yard it
seems that one day last August, while the gentleman
in question was riding upon a trolley on the Cerro
de Pasco railway, the conveyance was accidentally
overturned into a river, and he was badly injured
in the spine. A friend of his, a somewhat mysterious
Englishman named Cane, brought him down to
the hospital at Lima, and after two months there,
he becoming convalescent, was conveyed for fresh
air to Huacho, on the sea. Here he lived with Cane
in a small bungalow in a somewhat retired spot,
until on one night in February last year something
occurred&mdash;but exactly what, nobody is able to tell.
Sir Digby was found by his Peruvian servant dead
from snake-bite. Cane evinced the greatest distress
and horror until, of a sudden, a second man-servant
declared that he had heard his master cry out in
terror as he lay helpless in his bed. He heard him
shriek: 'You&mdash;you blackguard, Cane&mdash;take the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
thing away! Ah! God! You've&mdash;you've killed
me!' Cane denied it, and proved that he was at
a friend's house playing cards at the hour when
the servant heard his master shout for help. Next
day, however, he disappeared. Our Consul in Lima
took up the matter, and in due course a full report
of the affair was forwarded to the Yard, together
with a very detailed description of the man wanted.
This we sent around the world, but up to to-day
without result."</p>

<p>"Then the man Cane was apparently responsible
for the death of the invalid," I remarked.</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;without a doubt."</p>

<p>"But who was the invalid? Was he the real
Sir Digby?"</p>

<p>"Aye, that's the question," said Edwards,
thrusting his hands into his trouser pockets. For
some moments we both sat staring blankly into
the fire.</p>

<p>"Among the papers sent to us," he said very
slowly at last, "was this. Read it, and tell me
your opinion."</p>

<p>And then he took from his pocket-book and handed
me a half-sheet of thin foreign notepaper, which had
been closely written upon on both sides. It was
apparently a sheet from a letter, for there was no
beginning and no ending.</p>

<p>The handwriting was educated, though small and
crabbed, and the ink brown and half-faded, perhaps
because of its exposure to a tropical climate. It
had been written by a man, without a doubt.</p>

<p>"That," said Edwards, "was found in a pocket-book
belonging to Cane, which, in his hasty flight,
he apparently forgot. According to our report the
wallet was found concealed beneath the mattress of
his bed, as though he feared lest anyone should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
read and learn what it contained. Read it, and
tell me what you think."</p>

<p>I took the sheet of thin paper in my fingers, and,
crossing the room to a brighter light, managed to
decipher the writing as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"... At fourteen paces from where this wall
rises from the lawn stands the ever-plashing fountain.
The basin is circular, while around runs a paved path,
hemmed in by smoke-blackened laurels and cut off
from the public way by iron railings. The water
falls with pleasant cadence into a small basin set
upon a base of moss-grown rockwork. Looking
south one meets a vista of green grass, of never-ceasing
London traffic, and one tall distant factory
chimney away in the grey haze, while around the
fountain are four stunted trees. On the right
stretches a strip of garden, in spring green and gay
with bulbs which bloom and die unnoticed by the
hundreds upon hundreds of London's workers who
pass and re-pass daily in their mad, reckless hurry
to earn the wherewithal to live.</p>

<p>"Halt upon the gravel at that spot on the twenty-third
of the month punctually at noon, and she will
pass wearing the yellow flower. It is the only
trysting-place. She has kept it religiously for one
whole year without&mdash;alas!&mdash;effecting a meeting.
Go there&mdash;tell her that I still live, shake her hand
in greeting and assure her that I will come there as
soon as ever I am given strength so to do.</p>

<p>"I have been at that spot once only, yet every
detail of its appearance is impressed indelibly upon
my memory. Alas! that I do not know its
name. Search and you will assuredly find it&mdash;and
you will see her. You will speak, and give
her courage."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>I bit my lip.</p>

<p>A sudden thought illuminated my mind.</p>

<p>The yellow flower!</p>

<p>Was not the mysterious woman whom I was to
meet on the night of the fourteenth also to wear
a yellow flower&mdash;the mimosa!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>"DEAR OLD DIG."</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">I told</span> Edwards nothing of Sir Digby's curious
request, of his strange confidences, or of the mysterious
letter to "E. P. K.", which now reposed
in a locked drawer in my writing-table.</p>

<p>My friend, be he impostor or not, had always
treated me strictly honourably and well. Therefore,
I did not intend to betray him, although he might
be a fugitive hunted by the police.</p>

<p>Yet was he a fugitive? Did not his words to
me and his marvellous disguise prior to the tragedy
imply an intention to disappear?</p>

<p>The enigma was indeed beyond solution.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock my visitor, finding necessity to
revisit Harrington Gardens, I eagerly accompanied
him.</p>

<p>There is a briskness and brightness in Piccadilly
at seven o'clock on a clear, cold, winter's night
unequalled in any thoroughfare in the world. On
the pavements and in the motor-buses are thousands
of London's workers hurrying to their homes in
western suburbs, mostly the female employees of
the hundreds of shops and work-rooms which supply
the world's fashions&mdash;for, after all, London has now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
ousted Paris as the centre of the feminine mode&mdash;the
shops are still gaily lit, the club windows have not
yet drawn their blinds, and as motors and taxis
flash past eastward, one catches glimpses of pretty
women in gay evening gowns, accompanied by their
male escorts on pleasure bent: the restaurant,
the theatre, and the supper, until the unwelcome
cry&mdash;that cry which resounds at half-past twelve
from end to end of Greater London, "Time, please,
ladies and gentlemen. Time!"&mdash;the pharisaical
decree that further harmless merriment is forbidden.
How the foreigner laughs at our childish obedience
to the decree of the killjoys. And well he may,
especially when we know full well that while the
good people of the middle class are forced to return
to the dulness of their particular suburb, the people
of the class above them can sneak in by back doors
of unsuspected places, and indulge in drinking,
gambling, and dancing till daylight. Truly the
middle-class Londoner is a meek, obedient person.
One day, however, he may revolt.</p>

<p>Piccadilly was particularly bright and gay that
night, as, passing the end of St. James's Street, we
sped forward in the taxi towards Brompton Road
and past the Natural History Museum to Gloucester
Road.</p>

<p>On our arrival the door of the flat was opened by
a constable without a helmet. Recognising the
famous inspector, he saluted.</p>

<p>The body of the unknown girl had been removed
to the mortuary for a post-mortem examination,
but nothing else had been moved, and two officers
of the C.I.D. were busy making examination for
finger-prints.</p>

<p>I allowed them to take mine for comparison, but
some they found upon the mahogany table and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
upon the back of a chair were undoubtedly those of
the victim herself.</p>

<p>The small glass-topped specimen-table still lay
where it had been overturned, and the fragments of
the two green-glass flower-vases were strewn upon the
carpet with the drooping red anemones themselves.</p>

<p>Regarding the overturned table the two detectives
held that it had separated the assassin from his
victim; that the girl had been chased around it
several times before her assailant had thrown it
down, suddenly sprung upon her, and delivered the
fatal blow, full in her chest.</p>

<p>"We've thoroughly examined it for finger-prints,
sir," the elder of the two officers explained to my
companion. "Both on the glass top and on the
mahogany edge there are a number of prints of the
victim herself, as well as a number made by another
hand."</p>

<p>"A man's?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No; curiously enough, it seems to be a woman's,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"A woman's!"</p>

<p>I thought of that sweet perfume, and of the person
who had lurked in the shadow of the stairs!</p>

<p>"That's interesting," remarked Edwards. "They
may be those of the woman who wore green combs
in her hair, or else of the porter's wife."</p>

<p>"The owner's man-servant is away abroad on
business for his master, we've found out," answered
the man addressed. "So of late the porter's wife,
who lives in the basement of the next house, has
been in the habit of coming in every day and tidying
up the room. We took her prints this morning,
and have found quite a lot about the place. No,"
added the man emphatically, "the finger-prints on
that little table yonder are not those of the porter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
wife, but of another woman who's been here recently.
We only find them upon the door-handle and on the
edge of the writing-table, against which the woman
must have leaned. We'll have them photographed
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The men then showed us the marks in question&mdash;distinct
impressions of small finger-tips, which
they had rendered vivid and undeniable by the
application of a finely-powdered chalk of a pale
green colour.</p>

<p>Apparently the two experts had devoted the whole
day to the search for finger-print clues, and they
had established the fact that two women had been
there&mdash;the victim and another.</p>

<p>Who was she?</p>

<p>The investigation of the papers in my friend's
writing-table had not yet been made. Inspector
Edwards had telephoned earlier in the day, stating
that he would himself go through them.</p>

<p>Therefore, exercising every care not to obliterate
the three finger-marks upon the edge of the table, the
officers proceeded to break open drawer after
drawer and methodically examine the contents while
I looked on.</p>

<p>The work was exciting. At any moment we might
discover something which would throw light upon
the tragedy, the grim evidence of which remained
in that dark, still damp stain upon the carpet&mdash;the
life-blood of the unknown victim.</p>

<p>Already the face of the dead girl had been
photographed, and would, before morning, be
circulated everywhere in an endeavour to secure
identification.</p>

<p>I had learnt from Edwards that before noon that
morning, upon the notice-board outside Bow Street
Police Station, there had been posted one of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
pale, buff-coloured bills headed in great, bold
capitals: "Body found," in which the description
had been filled in by a clerkish hand, and at the
bottom a statement that the corpse was lying at the
Kensington Mortuary awaiting identification.</p>

<p>That she was a lady seemed established by her
dress, her well-kept hands, innocent of manual
labour, by the costly rings and bracelet she was
wearing, and the fact that, in the pocket of her
coat was found her purse containing eleven pounds
in gold and some silver.</p>

<p>Sir Digby's papers promised to be extremely
interesting, as we cleared the books off a side-table
and sat down to carefully investigate them.</p>

<p>The writing-table was a pedestal one, with a
centre drawer and four drawers on either side. The
first drawer burst open was the top one on the left,
and from it Edwards drew two bundles of letters,
each secured by faded pink tape.</p>

<p>These bundles he handed to me, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"See what you think of these, Mr. Royle!"</p>

<p>One after another I opened them. They were all
in the same sprawly handwriting of a woman&mdash;a
woman who simply signed herself "Mittie."</p>

<p>They were love-letters written in the long ago,
many commencing "My darling," or "Dearest,"
and some with "Dear old Dig."</p>

<p>Though it seemed mean of me to peer into the
closed chapter of my friend's history, I quickly
found myself absorbed in them. They were the
passionate outpourings of a brave but overburdened
heart. Most of them were dated from hotels in
the South of England and in Ireland, and were
apparently written at the end of the eighties. But
as no envelopes had been preserved they gave no
clue to where the addressee had been at the time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly all were on foreign notepaper, so we agreed
that he must have been abroad.</p>

<p>As I read, it became apparent that the writer and
the addressee had been deeply in love with one
another, but the lady's parents had forbidden their
marriage; and as, alas! in so many like cases, she
had been induced to make an odious but wealthier
marriage. The man's name was Francis.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He is, alas! just the same," she wrote in one
letter dated "Mount Ephraim Hotel, at Tunbridge
Wells, Thursday": "We have nothing in common.
He only thinks of his dividends, his stocks and
shares, and his business in the City always. I am
simply an ornament of his life, a woman who acts
as his hostess and relieves him of much trouble in
social anxieties. If father had not owed him
seventeen thousand pounds he would, I feel certain,
never have allowed me to marry him. But I paid
my father's debt with my happiness, with my very
life. And you, dear old Dig, are the only person
who knows the secret of my broken heart. You will
be home in London seven weeks from to-day. I
will meet you at the old place at three o'clock on
the first of October, for I have much&mdash;so very much&mdash;to
tell you. Father knows now how I hate this
dull, impossible life of mine, and how dearly I love
your own kind self. I told him so to-day, and he
pities me. I hope you will get this letter before
you leave, but I shall watch the movements of your
ship, and I shall meet you on the first of October.
Till then adieu.&mdash;Ever your own <span class="smcap">Mittie</span>."</p></div>

<p>At the old place! Where was it, I wondered?
At what spot had the secret meeting been effected
between the man who had returned from abroad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and the woman who loved him so well, though she had
been forced to become the wife of another.</p>

<p>That meeting had taken place more than twenty
years ago. What had been its result was shown
in the next letter I opened.</p>

<p>Written from the Queen's Hotel at Hastings on
the fourth of October, the unfortunate "Mittie,"
who seemed to spend her life travelling on the
South Coast, penned the following in a thin, uncertain
hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Our meeting was a mistake, Dig, a grave mistake.
We were watched by somebody in the employ of
Francis. When I returned to Tunbridge Wells he
taxed me with having met you, described our
trysting-place&mdash;the fountain&mdash;and how we had
walked and walked until, becoming too tired, we
had entered that quiet little restaurant to dine.
He has misjudged me horribly. The sneak who
watched us must have lied to him, or he would
never have spoken to me as he did&mdash;he would not
have insulted me. That night I left him, and am
here alone. Do not come near me, do not reply
to this. It might make matters worse. Though
we are parted, Dig, you know I love you and only
you&mdash;<i>you</i>! Still your own <span class="smcap">Mittie</span>."</p></div>

<p>I sat staring at that half-faded letter, taking no
heed of what Edwards was saying.</p>

<p>The fountain! They had met at the fountain,
and had been seen!</p>

<p>Could that spot be the same as mentioned in the
mysterious letter left behind by the fugitive Cane
after the sudden death of the Englishman away in
far-off Peru?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Did someone, after all the lapse of years, go there
on every twenty-third of the month at noon wearing
a yellow flower, to wait for a person who, alas!
never came?</p>

<p>The thought filled me with romance, even though
we were at that moment investigating a very remarkable
tragedy. Yet surely in no city in this
world is there so much romance, so much pathos,
such whole-hearted love and affection, or such
deep and deadly hatred as in our great palpitating
metropolis, where secret assassinations are of daily
occurrence, and where the most unpardonable sin
is that of being found out.</p>

<p>"What's that you've got hold of?" Edwards
asked me, as he crossed to the table and bent
over me.</p>

<p>I started.</p>

<p>Then, recovering myself&mdash;for I had no desire that
he should know&mdash;replied, quite coolly:</p>

<p>"Oh, only a few old letters&mdash;written long ago, in
the eighties."</p>

<p>"Ah! Ancient history, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, packing them together and retying
them with the soiled, pink tape. "But have
you discovered anything?"</p>

<p>"Well," he replied with a self-conscious smile,
"I've found a letter here which rather alters my
theory," and I saw that he held a piece of grey
notepaper in his hand. "Here is a note addressed
to him as long ago as 1900 in the name of Sir
Digby Kemsley! Perhaps, after all, the man
who died so mysteriously in Peru was an impostor,
and the owner of this place was the real
Sir Digby!"</p>

<p>"Exactly my own theory," I declared.</p>

<p>"But that fountain!" he remarked. "The foun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>tain
mentioned in the letter left behind by the man
Cane. We must take immediate steps to identify
it, and it must be watched on the twenty-third
for the coming of the woman who wears a yellow
flower. When we find her, we shall be able to
discover something very interesting, Mr. Royle.
Don't you agree?"</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>"TIME WILL PROVE."</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">These</span> are truly the fevered days of journalistic
enterprise the world over.</p>

<p>There are no smarter journalists than those of
Fleet Street, and none, not even in New York, with
scent more keen for sensational news. "The day's
story" is the first thought in every newspaper
office, and surely no story would have been a greater
"scoop" for any journal than the curious facts
which I have related in the foregoing pages.</p>

<p>But even though the gentlemen of the Press are
ubiquitous, many a curious happening, and many
a remarkable coroner's inquiry, often remain
unreported.</p>

<p>And so in this case. When, on the following
morning, the coroner for the borough of Kensington
held his inquiry in the little court off the High Street,
no reporter was present, and only half a dozen idlers
were seated in the back of the gloomy room.</p>

<p>When the jury had taken their seats after viewing
the remains, according to custom, the police inspector
reported to the coroner that the body remained
unidentified, though the description had been
telegraphed everywhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I might add, sir," went on the inspector, "that
there is strong belief that the young lady may be
a foreigner. Upon the tab of her coat she was
wearing was the name of a costumier: 'Sartori,
Via Roma.' Only the name of the street, and
not the town is given. But it must be somewhere
in Italy. We are in communication with
the Italian police with a view to ascertaining the
name of the town, and hope thus to identify the
deceased."</p>

<p>"Very well!" said the coroner, a shrewd, middle-aged,
clean-shaven man in gold pince-nez. "Let
us have the evidence," and he arranged his papers
with business-like exactitude.</p>

<p>The procedure differed in no way from that in
any other coroner's court in the kingdom, the
relation of dry details by matter-of-fact persons
spoken slowly in order that they might be carefully
taken down.</p>

<p>The scene was, indeed, a gloomy one, for the
morning was dark, and the place was lit by electric
light. The jury&mdash;twelve honest householders of
Kensington&mdash;appeared from the outset eager to get
back to their daily avocations. They were unaware
of the curious enigma about to be presented to
them.</p>

<p>Not until I began to give my evidence did
they appear to evince any curiosity regarding
the case. But presently, when I had related
my midnight interview with my friend, who was
now a fugitive, the foreman put to me several
questions.</p>

<p>"You say that after your return from your
visit from this man, Sir Digby Kemsley, he rang
you up on the telephone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did he say?" inquired the foreman, a
thin, white-headed man whose social standing
was no doubt slightly above that of his fellow
jurymen.</p>

<p>"He asked me to return to him at once," was
my reply.</p>

<p>"But this appears extraordinary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are not here to criticise the evidence, sir!"
interrupted the coroner sharply. "We are only
here to decide how the deceased came by her death&mdash;by
accident, or by violence. Have you any
doubt?"</p>

<p>The foreman replied in the negative, and refrained
from further cross-examining me.</p>

<p>The coroner himself, however, put one or two
pointed questions. He asked me whether I believed
that it had actually been Sir Digby speaking on the
second occasion, when I had been rung up, to
which I replied:</p>

<p>"At first, the voice sounded unfamiliar."</p>

<p>"At first! Did you recognise it afterwards?"</p>

<p>I paused for a few seconds, and then was compelled
to admit that I had not been entirely
certain.</p>

<p>"Voices are, of course, often distorted by the
telephone," remarked the coroner. "But in this
case you may have believed the voice to have been
your friend's because he spoke of things which
you had been discussing in private only half-an-hour
before. It may have been the voice of a
stranger."</p>

<p>"That is my own opinion, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he ejaculated, "and I entirely agree with
you, for if your friend had contemplated the crime
of murder he would scarcely have telephoned to
you to come back. He would be most anxious to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
get the longest start he could before the raising of
any hue and cry."</p>

<p>This remark further aroused the curiosity of the
hitherto apathetic jury, who sat and listened intently
to the medical evidence which followed.</p>

<p>The result of the doctor's examination was
quickly told, and not of great interest. He had
been called by the police and found the young
woman dying from a deep wound under the breast,
which had penetrated to the heart, the result of a
savage blow with some long, thin, and very sharp
instrument. The girl was not dead when he first
saw her, but she expired about ten minutes
afterwards.</p>

<p>"I should think that the weapon used was a
knife with a very sharp, triangular blade judging
from the wound," the spruce-looking doctor explained.
"The police, however, have failed to
discover it."</p>

<p>The words of the witness held me dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Have you ever met with knives with triangular
blades, doctor?" inquired the coroner.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" was the reply. "One sees them in
collections of medi&aelig;val arms. In ancient days they
were carried almost universally in Southern Europe&mdash;the
blade about nine inches long, and sometimes
perforated. Along the blade, grease impregnated
with mineral poison was placed, so that, on striking,
some of the grease would remain in the wound.
This form of knife was most deadly, and in Italy it
was known as a misericordia."</p>

<p>I sat there listening with open mouth. Why?
Because I knew where one of those curious knives
had been&mdash;one with a carved handle of cracked,
yellow ivory. I had often taken it up and looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
at the coat of arms carved upon the ivory&mdash;the
shield with the six balls of the princely house of
the Medici.</p>

<p>"And in your opinion, doctor, the deceased
came by her death from a blow from such a
weapon as you describe?" the coroner was
asking.</p>

<p>"That is my firm opinion. The wound penetrated
to the heart, and death was probably almost
instantaneous."</p>

<p>"Would she utter a cry?"</p>

<p>"I think she would."</p>

<p>"And yet no one seems to have heard any noise!"
remarked the coroner. "Is that so?" he asked,
turning to the police inspector.</p>

<p>"We have no evidence of any cry being heard,"
replied the officer. "I purposely asked the other
tenants of the flats above and below. But they
heard no unusual sound."</p>

<p>One of the detective-sergeants was then called;
Inspector Edwards, though present, being purposely
omitted. In reply to the coroner, he described the
finding of the body, its examination, and the
investigation which ensued.</p>

<p>"I need not ask you if you have any clue to the
assassin," said the coroner, when he had concluded
writing down the depositions. "I presume you are
actively prosecuting inquiries?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the brief response.</p>

<p>"I think, gentlemen," the coroner said, turning
at last to the jury, "that we can go no further with
this inquiry to-day. We must leave it for the police
to investigate, and if we adjourn, let us say for a
fortnight, we may then, I hope, have evidence of
identification before us. The case certainly presents
a number of curious features, not the least being the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
fact that the owner of the flat has mysteriously fled.
When he is found he will, no doubt, throw some light
upon the puzzling affair. I have to thank you for
your attendance to-day, gentlemen," he added,
addressing the dozen respectable householders, "and
ask you to be present again this day fortnight&mdash;at
noon."</p>

<p>There was evident dissatisfaction among the jury,
as there is always when a coroner's inquest is ever
adjourned.</p>

<p>It is certainly the reverse of pleasant to be
compelled to keep an appointment which may
mean considerable out-of-pocket expense and much
personal inconvenience.</p>

<p>One juror, indeed, raised an objection, as he had
to go to do business in Scotland. Whereupon the
coroner, as he rose, expressed his regret but declared
himself unable to assist him. It was, he remarked,
his duty as a citizen to assist in this inquiry, and to
arrive at a verdict.</p>

<p>After that the court rose, and every one broke
up into small groups to discuss the strange
affair of which the Press were at present in
ignorance.</p>

<p>Edwards had crossed the room and was speaking
to me. But I heard him not. I was thinking of
that triangular-bladed weapon&mdash;the "misericordia"
of the middle ages&mdash;so frequently used for stealthy
knife-thrusts.</p>

<p>"Coming?" he asked at last. This aroused me
to a sense of my surroundings, and I followed him
blindly out into the afternoon shopping bustle of
High Street, Kensington.</p>

<p>Outside the Underground Station were the flower-sellers.
Some were offering that tribute which the
Riviera never fails to send to us Londoners in spring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&mdash;sprigs
of mimosa: the yellow flower which would
be worn by the mysterious "E. P. K.," the written
message to whom reposed in my writing-table at
home.</p>

<p>Personally, I am not a man of mystery, but just
an ordinary London business man, differing in no
way to thousands of others who are at the head of
prosperous commercial concerns. London with all
its garish glitter, its moods of dulness and of
gaiety, its petrol-smelling streets, its farces of
passing life, and its hard and bitter dramas always
appealed to me. It was my home, the atmosphere
in which I had been born and bred, nay, my very
existence. I loved London and was ever true to
the city of my birth, even though its climate
might be derided, and Paris claimed as the one
city in which to find the acme of comfort and
enjoyment.</p>

<p>I had not sought mystery&mdash;far from it. It had
been thrust upon me, and now, as we went along
the High Street in Kensington, towards the police-station,
I found myself a sudden but important
factor in a stern chase&mdash;a man-hunt&mdash;such as
London had seldom known, for Edwards was saying
to me:</p>

<p>"At all hazards we must find your friend Kemsley,
and you, Mr. Royle, must help us. You know him,
and can identify him. There are grave suspicions
against him, and these must be cleared up in
view of the mysterious tragedy in Harrington
Gardens."</p>

<p>"You surely don't expect me to denounce my
friend!" I cried.</p>

<p>"It is not a question of denouncing him. His
own actions have rendered the truth patent to
every one. The girl was brutally killed, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
disappeared. Therefore he must be found,"
Edwards said.</p>

<p>"But who was it who telephoned to me, do you
think?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Himself, perhaps. He was full of inventiveness,
and he may have adopted that course hoping, when
the time came, to prove an alibi. Who knows?"
asked the famous inspector.</p>

<p>"Look here!" I said as we crossed the threshold
of the police-station, "I don't believe Sir Digby
was either an impostor or an assassin."</p>

<p>"Time will prove, Mr. Royle," he laughed with
an incredulous air. "A man don't take all these
precautions before disappearing unless he has a
deeper motive. Your friend evidently knew of the
lady's impending visit. Indeed, how could she have
entered the flat had he not admitted her?"</p>

<p>"She might have had a key," I hazarded.</p>

<p>"Might&mdash;but not very likely," he said. "No,
my firm conviction is that the man you know as
Sir Digby Kemsley struck the fatal blow, and took
the knife away with him."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, but did not reply.</p>

<p>Inside the station, we passed into the long room
devoted to the officers of the Criminal Investigation
Department attached to the division, and there
met two sergeants who had given evidence.</p>

<p>I was shown the photograph of the dead unknown,
calm, and even pretty, just as I had seen her lying
stretched in Digby's room.</p>

<p>"The medical evidence was curious, Mr. Royle,
wasn't it?" Edwards remarked. "That triangular
knife ought not to be very difficult to trace. There
surely are not many of them about."</p>

<p>"No," I replied faintly, for the recollection of one
which I had seen only a few days prior to the tragic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
occurrence&mdash;the one with the arms of the Medici
carved upon its hilt, arose vividly before me.</p>

<p>To me, alas! the awful truth was now plain.</p>

<p>My suspicion regarding the culprit had, by the
doctor's evidence, become entirely confirmed.</p>

<p>I set my jaws hard in agony of mind. What
was a mystery of London was to me no longer a
mystery!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE PIECE OF CONVICTION.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of the tenth of January was one of
those of gloom and darkness which are, on occasions,
the blots upon London's reputation.</p>

<p>There seemed no fog, only a heavy, threatening
cloud of night fell suddenly upon the city, and at
three o'clock it might have been midnight. Streets,
shops, and offices were lit everywhere, and buses
and taxis compelled to light up, while in the atmosphere
was a sulphurous odour with a black deposit
which caused the eyes to smart and the lungs to
irritate.</p>

<p>Londoners know those periods of unpleasant
darkness only too well.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my room in Albemarle Street,
watching Haines, who was cleaning a piece of old
silver I had bought at an auction on the previous day.
The collecting of old silver is, I may say, my hobby,
and the piece was a very fine old Italian reliquary,
about ten inches in height, with the Sicilian mark
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Haines, under my tuition, had become an expert
and careful cleaner of silver, and I was watching and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
exhorting him to exercise the greatest care, as the
ornamentation was thin, and some of the scrollwork
around the top extremely fragile. It had,
according to the inscription at its base, contained a
bone of a certain saint&mdash;a local saint of Palermo it
seemed&mdash;but the relic had disappeared long ago.
Yet the silver case which, for centuries, had stood
upon an altar somewhere, was a really exquisite
piece of the silversmith's art.</p>

<p>Suddenly the telephone-bell rang, and on answering
it I heard Phrida's voice asking&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Teddy, is that you? Why haven't you
been over since Thursday?"</p>

<p>I started, recollecting that I had not been to
Cromwell Road since the afternoon of the inquest&mdash;three
days ago.</p>

<p>"Dear, do forgive me," I craved. "I&mdash;I've been
so horribly busy. Had to be at the works each day."</p>

<p>"But you might have been over in the evening,"
she responded in a tone of complaint. "You
remember you promised to take me to the St.
James's last night, and I expected you."</p>

<p>"Oh, dearest, I'm so sorry," I said. "But I've
been awfully worried, you know. Do forgive me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know!" she answered. "Well, I'll
forgive you if you'll run over now and take me to tea
at the Leslies. I've ordered the car for four o'clock.
Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>The Leslies! They were snobbish folk with whom
I had but little in common. Yet what could I do
but agree?</p>

<p>And then my well-beloved rang off.</p>

<p>When I got down to Cromwell Road just before
four o'clock, the darkness had not lifted.</p>

<p>My feelings as I passed along the big, old-fashioned
hall and up the thickly-carpeted stairs to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
drawing-room were mixed ones of doubt, and yet
of deep affection.</p>

<p>Ah, I loved Phrida&mdash;loved her better than my
own life&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Fresh in my memory was the doctor's evidence
that the crime in Harrington Gardens had been
committed with a thin, triangular knife&mdash;a knife
such as that I had often seen lying upon the old-fashioned,
walnut what-not in the corner of the room
I was just about to enter. I had known it lying
in the same place for years.</p>

<p>Was it still there?</p>

<p>Purposely, because I felt that it could no longer
be there, I had refrained from calling upon my love,
and now, when I paused and turned the handle of
the drawing-room door, I hardly dared to cast my
eyes upon that antiquated piece of furniture.</p>

<p>Phrida, who was sitting with her hat and coat
already on, jumped up gaily to meet me.</p>

<p>"Oh, you really are prompt, Teddy!" she cried
with a flush of pleasure.</p>

<p>Then, as I bent over her mother's hand, the latter
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're quite a stranger, Mr. Royle. I expect
you have been very upset over the curious disappearance
of your friend. We've searched the
papers every day, but could find nothing whatever
about it."</p>

<p>Phrida had turned towards the fire, her pretty
head bent as she buttoned her glove.</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "Up to the present the newspapers
are in complete ignorance of the affair. But
no doubt they'll learn all about it before long."</p>

<p>Then, crossing the room to pick up a magazine
lying upon a chair, I halted against the old walnut
what-not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, the medi&aelig;val poignard was still lying there,
just as I had always seen it!</p>

<p>Had it been used, and afterwards replaced?</p>

<p>I scarcely dared to glance at it, lest I should
betray any unusual interest. I felt that Phrida's
eyes were watching me, that she suspected my
knowledge.</p>

<p>I took up the magazine idly, glanced at it, and,
replacing it, returned to her side.</p>

<p>"Well," she asked, "are you ready?"</p>

<p>And then together we descended to the car.</p>

<p>All the way up to Abbey Road she hardly spoke.
She seemed unusually pale and haggard. I asked
her what was the matter, but she only replied in a
faint, unnatural voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Matter? Why nothing&mdash;nothing, I assure you,
Teddy!"</p>

<p>I did not reply. I gazed upon the pretty, pale-faced
figure at my side in wonder and yet in fear.
I loved her&mdash;ah! I loved her well and truly, with all
my soul. Yet was it possible that by means of that
knife lying there so openly in that West-End drawing-room
a woman's life had been treacherously taken.</p>

<p>Had my friend Digby, the fugitive, actually
committed the crime?</p>

<p>When I put the whole matter clearly and with
common-sense before myself, I was bound to admit
that I had a strong belief of his innocence.</p>

<p>What would those finger-prints reveal?</p>

<p>The thought held me breathless. Yes, to satisfy
myself I would surreptitiously secure finger-prints
of my well-beloved and then in secret compare them
with those found in Sir Digby's rooms.</p>

<p>But how? I was reflecting as the car passed by
Apsley House and into the Park on its way to St.
John's Wood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Was I acting honestly? I doubted her, I quite
admit. Yet I felt that if I took some object&mdash;a
glass, or something with a polished surface&mdash;that she
had touched, and submitted it to examination, I
would be acting as a sneak.</p>

<p>The idea was repugnant to me. Yet with
that horrible suspicion obsessing me I felt
that I must do something in order to satisfy
myself.</p>

<p>What inane small talk I uttered in the Leslies' big,
over-furnished drawing-room I know not. All I
remember is that I sat with some insipid girl whose
hair was flaxen and as colourless as her mind,
sipping my tea while I listened to her silly chatter
about a Cook's tour she had just taken through
Holland and Belgium. The estimable Cook is, alas!
responsible for much tea-table chatter among the
fair sex.</p>

<p>Our hostess was an obese, flashily-dressed, dogmatic
lady, the wife of the chairman of a big
drapery concern who, having married her eldest
daughter to a purchased knighthood, fondly believed
herself to be in society&mdash;thanks to the "paid paragraphs"
in the social columns of certain morning
newspapers. It is really wonderful what half-guineas
will do towards social advancement in these
days! For a guinea one's presence can be recorded
at a dinner, or an at home, or one's departure
from town can be notified to the world in general
in a paragraph all to one's self&mdash;a paragraph which
rubs shoulders with those concerning the highest
in the land. The snobbery of the "social column"
would really be amusing were it not so painfully
apparent. A good press-agent will, for a fee, give
one as much publicity and newspaper popularity as
that enjoyed by a duke, and most amazing is it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
that such paragraphs are swallowed with keen
avidity by Suburbia.</p>

<p>The Leslies were an average specimen of the upper
middle-class, who were struggling frantically to
get into a good set. The old man was bald, pompous,
and always wore gold pince-nez and a fancy
waistcoat. He carried his shop manners into his
drawing-room, retaining his habit of rubbing his
hands in true shop-walker style when he wished
to be polite to his guests.</p>

<p>His wife was a loud-tongued and altogether impossible
person, who, it was said, had once served
behind the counter in a small shop in Cardiff,
but who now regarded the poor workers in her
husband's huge emporium as mere money-making
machines.</p>

<p>By dint of careful cultivation at bazaars and
such-like charitable functions she had scraped acquaintance
with a few women of title, to whom she
referred in conversation as "dear Lady So and So,
who said to me the other day," or "as my friend
Lady Violet always says."</p>

<p>She had buttonholed me at last, though I had
endeavoured to escape her, and was standing before
me like a pouter-pigeon pluming herself and endeavouring
to be humorous at the expense of a
very modest little married woman who had been
her guest that afternoon and had just left after
shaking my hand.</p>

<p>Women of Mrs. Leslie's stamp are perhaps the
most evil-tongued of all. They rise from obscurity,
and finding wealth at their command, imagine that
they can command obeisance and popularity. Woe
betide other women who arouse their jealousy, for
they will scandalise and blight the reputation of
the purest of their sex in the suburban belief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
that the invention of scandal is the hallmark of
smartness.</p>

<p>At last I got rid of her, thanks to the arrival
of an elegant young man, the younger son of a
well-known peer, to whom, of course, she was at
once all smiles, and, presently, I found myself out
in the hall with Phrida. I breathed more freely
when at last I passed into the keen air and entered
the car.</p>

<p>"Those people are impossible, dearest," I blurted
out when the car had moved away from the door.
"They are the most vulgar pair I know."</p>

<p>"I quite agree," replied my well-beloved, pulling
the fur rug over her knees. "But they are old
friends of mother's, so I'm compelled to go and see
them sometimes."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I sighed. "I suppose the old draper
will buy a knighthood at this year's sale for the
King's Birthday, and then his fat wife will have a
tin handle to her name."</p>

<p>"Really, Teddy, you're simply awful," replied
my companion. "If they heard you I wonder
what they would say?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," I replied frankly. "I only
speak the truth. The Government sell their titles
to anybody who cares to buy. Ah! I fear that
few men who really deserve honour ever get it
in these days. No man can become great unless
he has the influence of money to back him. The
biggest swindler who ever walked up Threadneedle
Street can buy a peerage, always providing he is
married and has no son. As old Leslie buys his
calicoes, ribbons and women's frills, so he'll buy
his title. He hasn't a son, so perhaps he'll fancy
a peerage and become the Lord Bargain of Sale."</p>

<p>Phrida laughed heartily at my biting sarcasm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Truth to tell, though I was uttering bitter sentiments,
my thoughts were running in a very different
direction. I was wondering how I could best
obtain the finger-prints of the woman who held
my future so irrevocably in her hands.</p>

<p>I had become determined to satisfy myself of
my love's innocence&mdash;or&mdash;can I write the words?&mdash;of
her guilt!</p>

<p>And as I sat there beside her, my nostrils again
became filled by that sweet subtle perfume&mdash;the
perfume of tragedy.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>FATAL FINGERS.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">Two</span> days passed.</p>

<p>Those finger-prints&mdash;impressions left by a woman&mdash;upon
the glass-topped specimen table in Sir
Digby's room and on the door handle, were puzzling
the police as they puzzled me. They had already
been proved not to be those of the porter's wife,
the lines being lighter and more refined.</p>

<p>According to Edwards, after the finger-prints
had been photographed, search had been made
in the archives at Scotland Yard, but no record could
be found that they were those of any person previously
convicted.</p>

<p>Were they imprints of the hand of my well-beloved?</p>

<p>I held my breath each time that black and terrible
suspicion filled my mind. I tried to put them aside,
but, like a nightmare, they would recur to me hourly
until I felt impelled to endeavour to satisfy myself
as to her guilt or her innocence.</p>

<p>I loved her. Yes, passionately and truly. Yet,
somehow, I could not prevent this ever-recurring
suspicion to fill my mind. There were so many
small points to be elucidated&mdash;the jingle of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
golden bangles, and especially the perfume, which
each time I entered her presence recalled to me all
the strange and unaccountable happenings of that
fatal night.</p>

<p>Again, who was the poor, unidentified victim&mdash;the
pale-faced, pretty young woman who had visited
Digby clandestinely, and gone to her death?</p>

<p>Up to the present the police notices circulated
throughout the country had failed to establish
who she was. Yet, if she were a foreigner, as
seemed so likely, identification might be extremely
difficult; indeed, she might ever remain a mystery.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock at night when I called
at Cromwell Road, for I had excused myself for
not coming earlier, having an object in view.</p>

<p>I found Phrida in the library, sweet and attractive
in a pale blue gown cut slightly <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;e</i>. She
and her mother had been out to dinner somewhere
in Holland Park, and had only just returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shand drew an armchair for me to the fire,
and we all three sat down to chat in the cosiness
of the sombre little book-lined den. Bain, the
old butler, who had known me almost since childhood,
placed the tantalus, a syphon and glasses
near my elbow, and at Phrida's invitation I poured
myself out a drink and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, "you will have your usual
lemonade"; and at my suggestion her mother
ordered Bain to bring a syphon of that harmless
beverage.</p>

<p>My love reached forward for one of the glasses,
whereupon I took one and, with a word of apology,
declared that it was not quite clean.</p>

<p>"Not clean!" exclaimed Mrs. Shand quickly.</p>

<p>"There are a few smears upon it," I said, and
adding "Excuse my handkerchief. It is quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
clean," I took the silk handkerchief I carried with
me purposely, and polished it with the air of a
professional waiter.</p>

<p>Both Phrida and her mother laughed.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Royle, you are full of eccentricities,"
declared Mrs. Shand. "You always remind me
of your poor father. He was most particular."</p>

<p>"One cannot be too careful, or guard sufficiently
against germs, you know," I said, handling the
clean glass carefully and pouring out the lemonade
from the syphon.</p>

<p>Phrida took the glass from my hand, and laughing
happily across its edge, drank. Her fingers were
leaving tell-tale impressions upon its surface. And
yet she was unconscious of my duplicity. Ah!
yes, I hated myself for my double dealing. And
yet so filled was I now by dark and breathless suspicion,
that I found myself quite unable to resist
an opportunity of establishing proof.</p>

<p>I watched her as she, in all innocence, leaned back
in the big saddle-bag chair holding her glass in
her hand and now and then contemplating it. The
impressions&mdash;impressions which could not lie&mdash;would
be the means of exonerating her&mdash;or of condemning
her.</p>

<p>Those golden bangles upon her slim white wrist
and that irritating perfume held me entranced.
What did she know concerning that strange tragedy
in Harrington Gardens. What, indeed, was the
secret?</p>

<p>My chief difficulty was to remain apparently
indifferent. But to do so was indeed a task. I
loved her, aye, with all my strength, and all my
soul. Yet the black cloud which had fallen upon
her was one of impenetrable mystery, and as I sat
gazing upon her through the haze of my cigarette<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
smoke, I fell to wondering, just as I had wondered
during all those hours which had elapsed since
I had scented that first whiff of Parfait d'Amour,
with which her chiffons seemed impregnated.</p>

<p>At last she put down her empty glass upon the
bookshelf near her. Several books had been
removed, leaving a vacant space.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shand had already risen and bade me good-night;
therefore, we were alone. So I rose from
my chair and, bending over her, kissed her fondly
upon the brow.</p>

<p>No. I would believe her innocent. That white
hand&mdash;the soft little hand I held in mine could
never have taken a woman's life. I refused to
believe it, and yet!</p>

<p>Did she know more of Sir Digby Kemsley than
she had admitted? Why had she gone to his flat
at that hour, lurking upon the stairs until he should
be alone, and, no doubt, in ignorance that I was his
visitor?</p>

<p>As I bent over her, stroking her soft hair with
my hand, I tried to conjure up the scene which
had taken place in Sir Digby's room&mdash;the tragedy
which had caused my friend to flee and hide himself.
Surely, something of a very terrible nature
must have happened, or my friend&mdash;impostor or
not&mdash;would have remained, faced the music, and
told the truth.</p>

<p>I knew Digby better than most men. The police
had declared him to be an impostor; nevertheless,
I still believed in him, even though he was now a
fugitive. Edwards had laughed at my faith in
the man who was my friend, but I felt within me a
strong conviction that he was not so black as pigheaded
officialdom had painted him.</p>

<p>The Council of Seven at Scotland Yard might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
be a clever combination of expert brains, but they
were not infallible, as had been proved so many
times in the recent annals of London crime.</p>

<p>Phrida had not referred to the tragedy, and I
had not therefore mentioned it.</p>

<p>My sole object at the moment was to obtain
possession of the empty glass and carry it with me
from the house.</p>

<p>But how could I effect this without arousing her
suspicion?</p>

<p>She had risen and stood with her back to the
blazing fire, her pretty lips parted in a sweet smile.
We were discussing a play at which she had been
on the previous evening, a comedy that had taken
the town by storm.</p>

<p>Her golden bangles jingled as she moved&mdash;that
same light metallic sound I had heard in the darkness
of the staircase at Harrington Gardens. My
eager fingers itched to obtain possession of that
glass which stood so tantalisingly within a couple
of feet of my hand. By its means I could establish
the truth.</p>

<p>"Well, Teddy," my beloved said at last, as she
glanced at the chiming clock upon the mantelshelf.
"It's past eleven, so I suppose I must go to bed.
Mallock is always in a bad temper if I keep her up
after eleven."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is only natural," I laughed.
"She often waits hours and hours for you. That
I know."</p>

<p>"Yes," she sighed. "But Mallock is really a
model maid. So much better than Rayne."</p>

<p>Personally, I did not like the woman Mallock.
She was a thin-nosed, angular person, who wore
pince-nez, and was of a decidedly inquisitive
disposition. But I, of course, had never shown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
any antagonism towards her; indeed, I considered
it diplomatic to treat her with tact and consideration.
She had been maid to the oldest daughter of a well-known
and popular countess before entering Phrida's
service, and I could well imagine that her principal
topic of conversation in the servants' hall was the
superiority of her late mistress, whose service she
had left on her marriage to a wealthy peer.</p>

<p>"I'm glad she is an improvement upon Rayne,"
I said, for want of something else to say, and, rising,
I took her little hand and pressed it to my lips
in farewell.</p>

<p>When she had kissed me I said:</p>

<p>"I'll just finish my cigarette, and I can let
myself out."</p>

<p>"Very well. But look in to-morrow, dear, won't
you?" she replied, as I opened the door for her
to pass. "Better still, I'll ring you up about
three o'clock and see what you are doing. Oh!
by the way, mother wants to remind you of your
promise to dine with us on Wednesday night. I
quite forgot. Of course you will&mdash;eight o'clock
as usual."</p>

<p>"Wednesday!" I exclaimed vaguely, recollecting
the acceptance of Mrs. Shand's invitation about a
week previously. "What date is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, the fourteenth."</p>

<p>"The fourteenth!" I echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes, why? Really, you look quite scared,
Freddy. What's the matter. Is anything terrible
going to happen on that date?" she asked, looking
at me with some concern.</p>

<p>"Going to happen&mdash;why?" I asked, striving
to calm myself.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well, because you look so horribly pale.
When I told you the date you gave quite a jump!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"A jump? Did I?" I asked, striving to remain
calm. "I didn't know, but, really, I'm filled with
great disappointment. I'm so sorry, but it will be
quite impossible for me to dine with you."</p>

<p>"Another engagement?" she said in a rather
irritated tone. "Going to some people whom
you like better than us, of course. You might
tell the truth, Teddy."</p>

<p>"The truth is that I have a prior engagement,"
I said. "One that I cannot break. I have to fulfill
faithfully a promise I gave to a very dear friend."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you do it some other time?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "Only on the evening of
the fourteenth."</p>

<p>"Then you can't come to us?" she asked with
a pout.</p>

<p>"I'll look in after," I promised. "But to dine is
entirely out of the question."</p>

<p>I saw that she was annoyed, but next moment
her lips parted again in a pretty smile, and she said:</p>

<p>"Very well, then. But remember, you will not
be later than ten, will you?"</p>

<p>"I promise not to be, dearest," I answered,
and kissing her, she ascended to her room.</p>

<p>The fourteenth! It was on that evening I
had to carry out the promise made to Digby and
meet the mysterious lady at the Piccadilly Circus
Tube Station&mdash;the person whose initials were
"E. P. K." and who would wear in her breast a
spray of mimosa.</p>

<p>I returned to the library, and for a second stood
thinking deeply. Would I, by that romantic
meeting, be placed in possession of some further
fact which might throw light upon the mystery?
Ah! would I, I wondered?</p>

<p>The empty glass caught my eye, and I was about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to cross and secure it when Bain suddenly entered.
Seeing me, he drew back quickly, saying: "I
beg pardon, sir. I thought you had gone. Will
you take anything more, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, not to-night, Bain," was my reply.</p>

<p>Whereupon the old servant glanced around for
the missing glass, and I saw with heart-sinking
that he placed it upon the tray to carry it back
to the servants' quarters.</p>

<p>The link which I had been so careful in preparing
was already vanishing from my gaze, when of
a sudden I said:</p>

<p>"I'll change my mind, Bain. I wonder if you
have a lemon in the house?"</p>

<p>"I'll go to the kitchen and see if cook has one,
sir," replied the old man, who, placing down the
tray, left to do my bidding.</p>

<p>In an instant I sprang forward and seized the
empty tumbler, handling it carefully. Swiftly,
I tore a piece off the evening paper, and wrapping it
around the glass, placed it in the pocket of my
dinner jacket.</p>

<p>Then, going into the hall, I put on my overcoat
and hat, and awaited Bain's return.</p>

<p>"I shan't want that lemon!" I cried to him as
he came up from the lower regions. "Good-night,
Bain!" and a few moments later I was in a taxi
speeding towards Albemarle Street, with the
evidence I wanted safe in my keeping.</p>

<p>That finger-prints remained on the polished surface
of the glass I knew full well&mdash;the prints of my
beloved's fingers.</p>

<p>But would they turn out to be the same as the
fingers which had rested upon the glass-topped
specimen-table in Digby's room?</p>

<p>Opening the door with my latch-key, I dashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
upstairs, eager to put my evidence to the proof
by means of the finely-powdered green chalk I had
already secured&mdash;the same as that used by the
police.</p>

<p>But on the threshold of my chambers Haines
met me with a message&mdash;a message which caused
me to halt breathless and staggered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CONTAINS FURTHER EVIDENCE.</h3>


<p class="gap2">"<span class="smcap">Sir Digby Kemsley</span> was here an hour ago, sir.
He couldn't wait!" Haines exclaimed, bringing
himself to attention.</p>

<p>"Sir Digby!" I gasped, starting. "Why, in
heaven's name, didn't you ring me up at Mrs.
Shand's?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Because he wouldn't allow me, sir. He came
to see you in strictest secrecy, sir. When I opened
the door I didn't know him. He's shaved off his
beard and moustache, and was dressed like a
clergyman."</p>

<p>"A clergyman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He looked just like a parson.
I wouldn't have known him in the street."</p>

<p>"An excellent ruse!" I exclaimed. "Of course,
Haines, you know that&mdash;well&mdash;that the police are
looking for him&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly well, but you can trust me, sir. I'll
say nothing. Sir Digby's a friend of yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, a great friend, and I feel that he's falsely
accused of that terrible affair which happened at his
flat," I said. "Did he promise to call again?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"He scribbled this note for you," Haines said,
taking up a letter from my blotting-pad.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers I tore it open, and upon
a sheet of my own notepaper read the hurriedly
written words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sorry you were out. Wanted to see you
most urgently. Keep your promise at Piccadilly
Circus, and know nothing concerning me. My
movements are most uncertain, as something
amazing has occurred which prevents me making
explanation. I will, however, send you my
address in secret as soon as I have one. I trust
you, Teddy, for you are my only friend.</p>

<p class="ralign smcap" style="padding-right:2em;">"Digby."</p></div>

<p>I read the note several times, and gathered that
he was in hourly fear of arrest. Every corner
held for him a grave danger. Yet what could have
occurred that was so amazing and which prevented
him speaking the truth.</p>

<p>That I had not been in when he called was truly
unfortunate. But by the fact that he was in clerical
attire I surmised that he was living in obscurity&mdash;perhaps
somewhere in the suburbs. London
is the safest city in the world in which to hide,
unless, of course, creditors or plaintiffs make it
necessary to seek peace "beyond the jurisdiction
of the Court."</p>

<p>Many a good man is driven to the latter course
through no fault of his own, but by the inexorable
demands of the Commissioners of Income Tax, or by
undue pressure from antagonistic creditors. Every
English colony on the Continent contains some who
have fallen victims&mdash;good, honest Englishmen&mdash;who
are dragging out the remainder of their lives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in obscurity, men whose names are perhaps household
words, but who conceal them beneath one
assumed.</p>

<p>Digby would probably join the throng of the
exiled. So I could do naught else than wait for
his promised message, even though I was frantic
in my anxiety to see and to question him regarding
the reason of the presence of my well-beloved
at his flat on that fatal night.</p>

<p>Imagine my bitter chagrin that I had not been
present to receive him! It might be many months
before I heard from him again, for his promise was
surely very vague.</p>

<p>Presently I took the glass very carefully from my
pocket, unwrapped it from its paper, and locked it
in a little cabinet in the corner of my room, until
next morning I brought it forth, and placing it upon
a newspaper powdered it well with the pale green
chalk which revealed at once a number of finger-marks&mdash;mine,
Bain's, and Phrida's.</p>

<p>I am something of a photographer, as everybody
is in these days of photo competitions. Therefore,
I brought out my Kodak with its anastigmat lens,&mdash;a
camera which I had carried for some years
up and down Europe, and after considerable arrangement
of the light, succeeded in taking a number
of pictures. It occupied me all the morning, and
even then I was not satisfied with the result. My
films might, for aught I know, be hopelessly fogged.</p>

<p>Therefore, with infinite care, I took the glass to a
professional photographer I knew in Bond Street,
and he also made a number of pictures, which were
duly developed and enlarged some hours later,
and showed the distinctive lines and curves of
each finger-print.</p>

<p>Not until the morning of the day following was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
I able to take these latter to Edwards, and then
a great difficulty presented itself. How was I
to explain how I had obtained the prints?</p>

<p>I sat for an hour smoking cigarettes furiously
and thinking deeply.</p>

<p>At last a plan presented itself, and taking a taxi
I went down to Scotland Yard, where I had no
difficulty in obtaining an interview in his airy,
barely-furnished business-like room.</p>

<p>"Hulloa, Mr. Royle!" he exclaimed cheerily
as I entered. "Sit down&mdash;well, do you know
anything more of that mysterious friend of yours&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>I did not reply. Why should I lie? Instead,
I said:</p>

<p>"I've been doing some amateur detective work.
Have you the photographs of those finger-prints
found on the specimen-table in Sir Digby's
room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," was his prompt reply, and going
over to a cupboard he brought out a pile of papers
concerning the case, and from it produced a number
of photographic prints.</p>

<p>My heart stood still when I saw them. Were
either of them exactly similar to any of those
I carried with me? I almost feared to allow
comparison to be made.</p>

<p>Edwards, noticing my hesitation, asked in what
quarter my efforts had been directed.</p>

<p>"I've been getting some finger-prints, that's
all," I blurted forth, and from my pocket drew the
large envelope containing the prints.</p>

<p>The detective took them across to the window
and regarded them very closely for some time, while
I looked eagerly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The curves and lines were extremely puzzling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
me, unaccustomed as I was to them. Edwards,
too, remained in silent indecision.</p>

<p>"We'll send them along to Inspector Tirrell
in the Finger-print Department," my friend said
at last. "He's an expert, and will tell at a glance if
any marks are the same as ours."</p>

<p>Then he rang a bell, and a constable, at his instructions,
carried all the prints to the department
in question.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Royle," exclaimed the inspector
when the door had closed; "how did you obtain
those prints?"</p>

<p>I was ready for his question, and a lie was at
once glibly upon my lips.</p>

<p>"Sir Digby, on the night of his disappearance,
returned to me a small steel despatch box which he
had borrowed some weeks before; therefore, after
the affair, I examined it for finger-prints, with the
result I have shown you," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah! but whatever prints were upon it were
there before the entrance of the victim to your
friend's rooms," he exclaimed. "He gave it to
you when you bade him good-night, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you carried the box home with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I repeated; in fear nevertheless, that
my lie might in some way incriminate me. Yet how
could I tell him of my suspicion of Phrida. That
secret was mine&mdash;and mine alone, and, if necessary,
I would carry it with me to the grave.</p>

<p>Edwards was again silent for some minutes.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Royle, I can't see that your evidence
helps us in the least. If there should be the same
prints on your despatch box as we found upon
the specimen-table, then what do they prove?&mdash;why,
nothing. If the box had been in the room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
at the time of the tragedy, then it might have given
us an important clue, because such an object would
probably be touched by any malefactor or assassin.
But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" I cried, interrupting. "Then you do
not suspect Sir Digby, after all&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Royle, but I did not say that
I held no suspicion," was his quiet answer. "Yet,
if you wish to know the actual truth, I, at present,
am without suspicion of anyone&mdash;except of that
second woman, the mysterious woman whose finger-prints
we have, and who was apparently in the
room at the same time as the unidentified victim."</p>

<p>"You suspect her, then?" I asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Not without further proof," he replied, with a
calm, irritating smile. "I never suspect unless I
have good grounds for doing so. At present we
have three clear finger-prints of a woman whom
nobody saw enter or leave, just as nobody saw the
victim enter. Your friend Sir Digby seems to
have held a midnight reception of persons of
mysterious character, and with tragic result."</p>

<p>"I feel sure he is no assassin," I cried.</p>

<p>"It may have been a drama of jealousy&mdash;who
knows?" said Edwards, standing erect near the
window and gazing across at me. "Your friend,
in any case, did not care to remain and explain
what happened. A girl&mdash;an unknown girl&mdash;was
struck down and killed."</p>

<p>"By whom, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Royle, the identity of the assassin
is what we are endeavouring to discover," he replied
gravely. "We must first find this man who has
so successfully posed as Sir Digby Kemsley. He is
a clever and elusive scoundrel, without a doubt.
But his portrait is already circulated both here and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
on the Continent. The ports are all being watched,
while I have five of the best men I can get engaged
on persistent inquiry. He'll try to get abroad,
no doubt. No doubt, also, he has a banking account
somewhere, and through that we shall eventually
trace him. Every man entrusts his banker with
his address. He has to, in order to obtain money."</p>

<p>"Unless he draws his money out in cash and then
goes to a tourist agency and gets a letter of credit."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, that's often done," my friend admitted.
"The tourist agencies are of greatest use to thieves
and forgers. They take stolen notes, change them
into foreign money, and before the numbers can
be circulated are off across the Channel with their
booty. If we look for stolen notes we are nearly
certain to find them in the hands of a tourist agency
or a money-changer."</p>

<p>"Then you anticipate that you may find my
friend Digby through his bankers?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," was his vague answer. "But as he
is your friend, Mr. Royle, I perhaps ought not to
tell you of the channels of information we are
trying," he added, with a dry laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, I assure you I'm entirely ignorant of his
whereabouts," I said. "If I knew, I should
certainly advise him to come and see you."</p>

<p>"Ah! you believe in his innocence, I see?"</p>

<p>"I most certainly do!"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;we shall see&mdash;we shall see," he said in
that pessimistic tone which he so often adopted.</p>

<p>"What are you doing about those letters&mdash;that
letter which mentions the fountain?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I've dismissed those as private
correspondence regarding some love episode of
the long ago," he replied. "They form no clue,
and are not worth following."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the constable re-entered bearing
the photographs.</p>

<p>"Well, what does Inspector Tirrell say?"
Edwards asked quickly of the man.</p>

<p>"He has examined them under the glass, sir, and
says that they are the same prints in both sets
of photographs&mdash;the thumb and index-finger of a
woman&mdash;probably a young and refined woman.
He's written a memo there, sir."</p>

<p>Edwards took it quickly, and after glancing at
it, handed it to me to read.</p>

<p>It was a mere scribbled line signed with the
initials "W. H. T.," to the effect that the same
prints appeared in both photographs, and concluded
with the words "No record of this person is known
in this department."</p>

<p>I know I stood pale and breathless at the revelation&mdash;at
the incontestable proof that my well-beloved
had actually been present in Digby's room
after my departure on that fatal night.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>By dint of a great effort I succeeded in suppressing
the flood of emotions which so nearly overcame me,
and listened to Edwards as he remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, after all, Mr. Royle, it doesn't carry us
any further. Our one object is to discover the
identity of the woman in question, and I think we
can only do that from your absconding friend himself.
If the marks are upon your despatch-box as
you state, then the evidence it furnishes rather
disproves the theory that the unknown woman
was actually present at the time of the tragedy."</p>

<p>I hardly know what words I uttered.</p>

<p>I had successfully misled the great detective of
crime, but as I rode along in the taxi back to my
rooms, I was in a frenzy of despair, for I had proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
beyond a shadow of doubt that Phrida was aware
of what had occurred&mdash;that a black shadow of guilt
lay upon her.</p>

<p>The woman I had loved and trusted, she who was
all the world to me, had deceived me, though she
smiled upon me so sweetly. She, alas! held within
her breast a guilty secret.</p>

<p>Ah! in that hour of my bitterness and distress
the sun of my life became eclipsed. Only before
me was outspread a limitless grey sea of dark
despair.</p>

<h3>DESCRIBES THE YELLOW SIGN.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> night of my mysterious tryst&mdash;the night of
January the fourteenth&mdash;was dark, rainy, and
unpleasant.</p>

<p>That afternoon I had taken out the sealed letter
addressed to "E. P. K." and turned it over thoughtfully
in my hand.</p>

<p>I recollected the words of the fugitive. He had
said:</p>

<p>"On the night of the fourteenth just at eight
o'clock precisely, go to the Piccadilly Tube Station
and stand at the first telephone box numbered four,
on the Haymarket side, when a lady in black will
approach you and ask news of me. In response you
will give her this note. But there is a further
condition. You may be watched and recognised.
Therefore, be extremely careful that you are not
followed on that day, and, above all, adopt some
effective disguise. Go there dressed as a working
man, I would suggest."</p>

<p>Very strange was that request of his. It filled
me with eager curiosity. What should I learn
from the mysterious woman in black who was to
come to me for a message from my fugitive friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Had he already contemplated flight when he had
addressed the note to her and made the appointment,
I wondered.</p>

<p>If so, the crime at Harrington Gardens must have
been premeditated.</p>

<p>I recollected, too, those strange, prophetic
words which my friend had afterwards uttered,
namely:</p>

<p>"I want you to give me your promise, Royle.
I ask you to make a solemn vow to me that if
any suspicion arises within your mind, that you
will believe nothing without absolute and
decisive proof. I mean, that you will not misjudge
her."</p>

<p>By "her" he had indicated the lady whose initials
were "E. P. K."</p>

<p>It was certainly mysterious, and my whole mind
was centred upon the affair that day.</p>

<p>As I stood before my glass at seven o'clock that
evening, I presented a strange, uncanny figure,
dressed as I was in a shabby suit which I had
obtained during the day from a theatrical costumier's
in Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Haines, to whom I had invented a story that I was
about to play a practical joke, stood by much
amused at my appearance.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he exclaimed; "you look just like
a bricklayer's labourer!"</p>

<p>The faded suit, frayed at the wrists and elbows,
had once been grey, but it was now patched, brown,
smeared with plaster, and ingrained with white
dust, as was the ragged cap; while the trousers
were ragged at the knees and bottoms. Around
my neck was a dirty white scarf and in my hand
I carried a tin tea-bottle as though I had just
returned from work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," I remarked, regarding myself critically.
"Not even Miss Shand would recognise me&mdash;eh,
Haines?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I'm sure she wouldn't. But you'll
have to dirty your face and hands a bit. Your
hands will give you away if you're not careful."</p>

<p>"Yes. I can't wear gloves, can I?" I remarked.</p>

<p>Thereupon, I went to the grate and succeeded
in rubbing ashes over my hands and applying some
of it to my cheeks&mdash;hardly a pleasant face powder,
I can assure you.</p>

<p>At a quarter to eight, with the precious letter
in the pocket of my ragged jacket, I left Albemarle
Street and sauntered along Piccadilly towards
the Circus. The rain had ceased, but it was wet underfoot,
and the motor buses plashed foot passengers
from head to foot with liquid mud. In my
walk I passed, outside the Piccadilly Hotel, two
men I knew. One of them looked me straight in
the face but failed to recognise me.</p>

<p>Piccadilly Circus, the centre of the night-life of
London, is unique, with its jostling crowds on
pleasure bent, its congestion of traffic, its myriad
lights, its flashing, illuminated signs, and the bright
fa&ccedil;ade of the Criterion on the one side and the
Pavilion on the other. Surely one sees the lure of
London there more than at any other spot in the
whole of our great metropolis.</p>

<p>Passing the Criterion and turning into the Haymarket,
I halted for a moment on the kerb, and for
the first time in my life, perhaps, gazed philosophically
upon the frantic, hurrying panorama of human
life passing before my eyes.</p>

<p>From where I stood I could see into the well-lit
station entrance with the row to the telephone boxes,
at the end of which sat the smart young operator,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
who was getting numbers and collecting fees. All
the boxes were engaged, and several persons were
waiting, but in vain my eyes searched for a lady
in black wearing mimosa.</p>

<p>The winter wind was bitterly cold, and as I was
without an overcoat it cut through my thin, shabby
clothes, causing me to shiver. Nevertheless, I
kept my watchful vigil. By a neighbouring clock I
could see that it was already five minutes past the
hour of the appointment. Still, I waited in eager
expectation of her coming.</p>

<p>The only other person who seemed to loiter
there was a thin, shivering Oriental, who
bore some rugs upon his shoulder&mdash;a hawker of
shawls.</p>

<p>Past me there went men and women of every
grade and every station. Boys were crying "Extrur
spe-shull," and evil-looking loafers, those foreign
scoundrels who infest the West End, lurked about,
sometimes casting a suspicious glance at me,
with the thought, perhaps, that I might be a
detective.</p>

<p>Ah! the phantasmagora of life outside the Piccadilly
Tube at eight o'clock in the evening is indeed
a strangely complex one. The world of London
has then ceased to work and has given itself over to
pleasure, and, alas! in so many cases, to evil.</p>

<p>In patience I waited. The moments seemed
hours, for in my suspense I was dubious whether,
after all, she would appear. Perhaps she already
knew, by some secret means, of Sir Digby's
flight, and if so, she would not keep the appointment.</p>

<p>I strolled up and down the pavement, for a
policeman, noticing me hanging about, had gruffly
ordered me to "Move on!" He, perhaps, suspected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
me of "loitering for the purpose of committing a
felony."</p>

<p>Everywhere my eager eyes searched to catch
sight of some person in black wearing a spray
of yellow blossom, but among that hurrying
crowd there was not one woman, young or
old, wearing that flower so reminiscent of the
Riviera.</p>

<p>I entered the station, and for some moments stood
outside the telephone box numbered 4. Then,
with failing heart, I turned and went along to
the spacious booking-hall, where the lifts
were ever descending with their crowds of
passengers.</p>

<p>Would she ever come? Or, was my carefully
planned errand entirely in vain?</p>

<p>I could not have mistaken the date, for I had
made a note of it in my diary directly on my return
from Harrington Gardens, and before I had learned
of the tragedy. No. It now wanted a quarter to
nine and she had not appeared. At nine I would
relinquish my vigil, and assume my normal identity.
I was sick to death of lounging there in the cutting
east wind with the smoke-blackened tin bottle in
my hand.</p>

<p>I had been idly reading an advertisement on the
wall, and turned, when my quick eyes suddenly
caught sight of a tall, well-dressed woman of middle
age, who, standing with her back to me, was speaking
to the telephone-operator.</p>

<p>I hurried eagerly past her, when my heart gave
a great bound. In the corsage of her fur-trimmed
coat she wore the sign for which I had been searching
for an hour&mdash;a sprig of mimosa!</p>

<p>With my heart beating quickly in wild excitement,
I drew back to watch her movements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>She had asked the operator for a number, paid
him, and was told that she was "on" at box
No. 4.</p>

<p>I saw her enter, and watched her through the glass
door speaking vehemently with some gesticulation.
The answer she received over the wire seemed to
cause her the greatest surprise, for I saw how her
dark, handsome face fell when she heard the
response.</p>

<p>In a second her manner changed. From a bold,
commanding attitude she at once became apprehensive
and appealing. Though I could not hear
the words amid all that hubbub and noise, I knew
that she was begging the person at the other end
to tell her something, but was being met with a
flat refusal.</p>

<p>I saw how the black-gloved hand, resting upon the
little ledge, clenched itself tightly as she listened.
I fancied that tears had come into her big,
dark eyes, but perhaps it was only my imagination.</p>

<p>At last she put down the receiver and emerged
from the box, with a strange look of despair upon
her handsome countenance.</p>

<p>What, I wondered, had happened?</p>

<p>She halted outside the box for a moment, gazing
about her as though in expectation of meeting
someone. She saw me, but seeing only a labourer,
took no heed of my presence. Then she glanced at
the tiny gold watch in her bracelet, and noting that
it was just upon nine, drew a long breath&mdash;a sigh
as though of despair.</p>

<p>I waited until she slowly walked out towards
the street, and following, came up beside her and
said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I wonder, madame, if you are looking for me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>She glanced at me quickly, with distinct suspicion,
and noting my dress, regarded me with some
disdain.</p>

<p>Her dark brows were knit for a second in distinct
displeasure, even of apprehension, and then in
an instant I recollected my friend's injunction
that I might be watched and followed. In giving
her the message the greatest secrecy was to be
observed.</p>

<p>She halted, as though in hesitation, took from her
bag a tiny lace handkerchief and dabbed her face,
then beneath her breath, and without glancing
further at me, said:</p>

<p>"Follow me, and I will speak to you presently&mdash;when
there is no danger."</p>

<p>Upon that I moved away and leisurely lit my
pipe, as though entirely unconcerned, while she
still stood in the doorway leading to the Haymarket,
looking up and down as though awaiting
somebody.</p>

<p>Yes, she was a distinctly handsome woman;
tall, erect, and well preserved. Her gown fitted
her perfectly, and her black jacket, trimmed with
some rich dark fur, was a garment which gave her
the stamp of a woman of wealth and refinement.
She wore a neat felt hat also trimmed with fur, white
gloves, and smart shoes, extremely small, even
girlish, for a woman so well developed.</p>

<p>Presently she sauntered forth down the Haymarket,
and a few moments afterwards, still
smoking and carrying my bottle, I lounged lazily
after her.</p>

<p>At the corner, by the Carlton, she turned into
Pall Mall, continuing along that thoroughfare
without once looking back. Opposite the United
Service Club she crossed the road, and passing across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the square in front of the Athen&aelig;um, descended the
long flight of steps which led into the Mall.</p>

<p>There in the darkness, beneath the trees, where
there were no onlookers&mdash;for at that hour the Mall
is practically deserted, save for a few loving couples
and a stray taxi or two&mdash;she suddenly paused, and
I quickly approached and raised my cap politely.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked sharply, almost in a tone
of annoyance. "What is it? What do you want
with me, my man?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>CHERCHEZ LA FEMME.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">I confess</span> that her attitude took me aback.</p>

<p>I was certainly unprepared for such a reception.</p>

<p>"I believed, madame, that you were in search of
me?" I said, with polite apology.</p>

<p>"I certainly was not. I don't know you in the
least," was her reply. "I went to the Tube to meet
a friend who did not keep his appointment. Is
it possible that you have been sent by him? In
any case, it was very injudicious for you to approach
me in that crowd. One never knows who might
have been watching."</p>

<p>"I come as messenger from my friend, Sir Digby
Kemsley," I said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"From him?" she gasped eagerly. "I&mdash;ah!
I expected him. Is he prevented from coming?
It was so very important, so highly essential, that
we should meet," she added in frantic anxiety
as we stood there in the darkness beneath the
bare trees, through the branches of which the wind
whistled weirdly.</p>

<p>"I have this letter," I said, drawing it from
my pocket. "It is addressed 'For E. P. K.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"For me?" she cried with eagerness, as she took it
in her gloved hand, and then leaving my side she
hurried to a street lamp, where she tore it open and
read the contents.</p>

<p>From where I stood I heard her utter an ejaculation
of sudden terror. I saw how she crushed
the paper in one hand while with the other she
pressed her brow. Whatever the letter contained
it was news which caused her the greatest apprehension
and fear, for dashing back to me she
asked:</p>

<p>"When did he give you this? How long
ago?"</p>

<p>"On the night of January the sixth," was
my reply. "The night when he left Harrington
Gardens in mysterious circumstances."</p>

<p>"Mysterious circumstances!" she echoed.
"What do you mean? Is he no longer there?"</p>

<p>"No, madame. He has left, and though I am,
perhaps, his most intimate friend, I am unaware
of his whereabouts. There were," I added, "reasons,
I fear, for his disappearance."</p>

<p>"Who are you? Tell me, first."</p>

<p>"My name is Edward Royle," was my brief
response.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Royle," the woman cried, "he
has spoken of you many times. You were his best
friend, he said. I am glad, indeed, to meet you,
but&mdash;but tell me why he has disappeared&mdash;what has
occurred?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would probably know that
my friend is wanted by the police," I replied gravely.
"His description has been circulated everywhere."</p>

<p>"But why?" she gasped, staring at me. "Why
are the police in search of him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few seconds I hesitated, disinclined to
repeat the grave charge against him.</p>

<p>"Well," I said at last in a low, earnest voice,
"the fact is the police have discovered that
Sir Digby Kemsley died in South America some
months ago."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," she said.</p>

<p>"Then I will be more plain. The police, having
had a report of the death of Sir Digby, believe our
mutual friend to be an impostor!"</p>

<p>"An impostor! How utterly ridiculous. Why,
I myself can prove his identity. The dead man
must have been some adventurer who used his
name."</p>

<p>"That is a point which I hope with your assistance
to prove," I said. "The police at present
regard our friend with distinct suspicion."</p>

<p>"And I suppose his worst enemy has made
some serious allegation against him&mdash;that woman
who hates him so. Ah! I see it all now. I see
why he has written this to me&mdash;this confession
which astounds me. Ah! Mr. Royle," she added,
her gloved hands tightly clenched in her despair.
"You do not know in what deadly peril Sir Digby
now is. Yes, I see it plainly. There is a charge
against him&mdash;a grave and terrible charge&mdash;which
he is unable to refute, and yet he is perfectly
innocent. Oh, what can I do? How can I act
to save him?" and her voice became broken by
emotion.</p>

<p>"First tell me the name of this woman who was
such a deadly enemy of his. If you reveal this to me,
I may be able to throw some light upon circumstances
which are at the present moment a complete
mystery."</p>

<p>"No, that is his secret," was her low, calm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
reply. "He made me swear never to reveal the
woman's name."</p>

<p>"But his honour&mdash;nay, his liberty&mdash;is now at
stake," I urged.</p>

<p>"That does not exonerate me from breaking my
word of honour, Mr. Royle."</p>

<p>"Then he probably entertains affection for the
woman, and is hence loth to do anything which
might cause her pain. Strangely enough, men often
love women whom they know are their bitterest
enemies."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But the present case is full of strange
and romantic facts&mdash;facts, which if written down,
would never be believed. I know many of them
myself, and can vouch for them."</p>

<p>"Well, is this unnamed woman a very vengeful
person?" I asked, remembering the victim who
had been found dead at Harrington Gardens.</p>

<p>"Probably so. All women, when they hate
a man, are vengeful."</p>

<p>"Why did she hate him so?"</p>

<p>"Because she believed a story told of him&mdash;an
entirely false story&mdash;of how he had treated
the man she loved. I taxed him with it, and he
denied it, and brought me conclusive proof that
the allegation was a pure invention."</p>

<p>"Is she young or middle-aged?"</p>

<p>"Young, and distinctly pretty," was her reply.</p>

<p>Was it possible that this woman was speaking of
that girl whom I had seen lying dead in my friend's
flat? Had he killed her because he feared what
she might reveal? How dearly I wished that
I had with me at that moment a copy of
the police photographs of the unidentified
body.</p>

<p>But even then she would probably declare it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
not to be the same person, so deeply had Sir Digby
impressed upon her the necessity of regarding the
affair as strictly secret.</p>

<p>Indeed, as I walked slowly at her side, I saw that,
whatever the note contained, it certainly had
the effect upon her of preserving her silence.</p>

<p>In that case, could the crime have been premeditated
by my friend? Had he written her
that secret message well knowing that he intended
to kill the mysterious woman who was his deadliest
enemy.</p>

<p>That theory flashed across my brain as I walked
with her, and I believed it to be the correct one.
I accepted it the more readily because it removed
from my mind those dark suspicions concerning
Phrida, and, also, in face of facts which this
unknown lady had dropped, it seemed to be
entirely feasible.</p>

<p>Either the unsuspecting woman fell by the hand
of Digby Kemsley or&mdash;how can I pen the words&mdash;by
the hand of Phrida, the woman I loved. There
was the evidence that a knife with a triangular
blade had been used, and such a knife had been,
and was still, in the possession of my well-beloved;
but from what I had learned that night it seemed
that, little as I had dreamed the truth, my friend
Digby had been held in bondage by a woman, whose
tongue he feared.</p>

<p>Ah! How very many men in London are the
slaves of women whom they fear. All of us are
human, and the woman with evil heart is, alas!
only too ready to seize the opportunity of the frailty
of the opposite sex, and whatever may be the
secret she learns, of business or of private
life, she will most certainly turn it to her
advantage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>It was similar circumstances I feared in the
case of dear old Digby.</p>

<p>I was wondering, as I walked, whether I should
reveal to my companion&mdash;whose name she had
told me was Mrs. Petre&mdash;the whole of the tragic
circumstances.</p>

<p>"Is it long ago since you last saw Digby?"
I asked her presently, as we strolled slowly together,
and after I had given her my address, and we
had laughed together over my effective
disguise.</p>

<p>"Nearly two months," she replied. "I've been
in Egypt since the beginning of November&mdash;at
Assuan."</p>

<p>"I was there two seasons ago," I said. "How
delightful it is in Upper Egypt&mdash;and what a climate
in winter! Why, it is said that it has never rained
there for thirty years!"</p>

<p>"I had a most awfully jolly time at the Cataract.
It was full of smart people, for only the suburbs,
the demi-monde, and Germans go to the Riviera
nowadays. It's so terribly played out, and the
Carnival gaiety is so childish and artificial."</p>

<p>"It amuses the Cookites," I laughed; "and it
puts money in the pockets of the hotel-keepers of
Nice and the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"Monte is no longer <i>chic</i>," she declared. "German
women in blouses predominate; and the really
smart world has forsaken the Rooms for Cairo,
Heliopolis, and Assuan. They are too far off
and too expensive for the bearer of Cook's
coupons."</p>

<p>I laughed. She spoke with the nonchalant air
of the smart woman of the world, evidently much
travelled and cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>But I again turned the conversation to our mutual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
friend, and strove with all the diplomatic powers
I possessed to induce her to reveal the name or
give me a description of the woman whom she
had alleged to be his enemy&mdash;the woman who was
under a delusion that he had wronged her lover.
To all my questions, however, she remained
dumb. That letter which I had placed in her
hand had, no doubt, put a seal of silence upon
her lips.</p>

<p>At one moment she assumed a haughtiness of
demeanour which suited her manner and bearing,
at the next she became sympathetic and eager.
She was, I gauged, a woman of strangely complex
character. Yet whom could she be? I knew most,
perhaps even all, of Digby's friends, I believed. He
often used to give cosy little tea parties, to which
women&mdash;many of them well known in society&mdash;came.
Towards them he always assumed quite
a paternal attitude, for he was nothing if not a
ladies' man.</p>

<p>She seemed very anxious to know in what
circumstances he had handed me the note, and
what instructions he had given me. To her
questions I replied quite frankly. Indeed, I
repeated his words.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes," she cried. "He urged you not
to misjudge me. Then you will not, Mr.
Royle&mdash;will you?" she asked me with sudden
earnestness.</p>

<p>"I have no reason to misjudge you, Mrs. Petre,"
I said, quietly. "Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Ah! but you may. Indeed, you most certainly
will."</p>

<p>"When?" I asked, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"When&mdash;when you know the bitter truth."</p>

<p>"The truth of what?" I gasped, my thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
reverting to the tragedy in Harrington Gardens.
Though I had not referred to it I felt that she must
be aware of what had occurred, and of the real
reason of Digby's flight.</p>

<p>"The truth which you must know ere long,"
she answered hoarsely as we halted again beneath
the leafless trees. "And when you learn it you
will most certainly condemn me. But believe me,
Mr. Royle, I am like your friend, Sir Digby, more
sinned against than sinning."</p>

<p>"You speak in enigmas," I said.</p>

<p>"Because I cannot&mdash;I dare not tell you what
I know. I dare not reveal the terrible and
astounding secret entrusted to me. You will know
it all soon enough. But&mdash;there," she added in
a voice broken in despair, "what can matter
now that Digby has shown the white feather&mdash;and
fled."</p>

<p>"He was not a coward, Mrs. Petre," I remarked
very calmly.</p>

<p>"No. He was a brave and honest man
until&mdash;&mdash;" and she paused, her low voice fading
to a whisper that I did not catch.</p>

<p>"Until what?" I asked. "Did something
happen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it did," she replied in a hard, dry tone.
"Something happened which changed his
life."</p>

<p>"Then he is not the impostor the police believe?"
I demanded.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," was her prompt reply. "Why
he has thought fit to disappear fills me with anger.
And yet&mdash;yet from this letter he has sent to me
I can now see the reason. He was, no doubt, compelled
to fly, poor fellow. His enemy forced him
to do so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"The woman&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the woman," she admitted, bitter hatred
in her voice.</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, I said: "If I can be of
any service to you, Mrs. Petre, for we are both
friends of Digby's, I trust you will not fail to
command me."</p>

<p>And I handed her a card from my case, which
I had carried expressly.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Mr. Royle," she replied.
"Perhaps I may be very glad of your services
one day. Who knows? I live at Park Mansions."</p>

<p>"And may I call?"</p>

<p>"For the present, no. I let my flat while I went
abroad, and it is still occupied for several weeks.
I shall not be there before the first week in
March."</p>

<p>"But I want to find Digby&mdash;I want to see him
most urgently," I said.</p>

<p>"And so do I!"</p>

<p>"How can we trace him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ah! I am afraid he is far too elusive. If he
wishes to hide himself we need not hope to find
him until he allows us to," she replied. "No, all
we can do is to remain patient and hopeful."</p>

<p>Again a silence fell between us. I felt instinctively
that she wished to confide in me, but dare
not do so.</p>

<p>Therefore I exclaimed suddenly:</p>

<p>"Will you not tell me, Mrs. Petre, the identity of
this great enemy of our friend&mdash;this woman?
Upon information which you yourself may give,
Digby's future entirely depends," I added
earnestly.</p>

<p>"His future!" she echoed. "What do you
mean?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean only that I am trying to clear his good
name of the stigma now resting upon it."</p>

<p>The handsome woman bit her lip.</p>

<p>"No," she replied with a great effort. "I'm
sorry&mdash;deeply sorry&mdash;but I am now in a most
embarrassing position. I have made a vow to him,
and that vow I cannot break without first obtaining
his permission. I am upon my honour."</p>

<p>I was silent. What could I say?</p>

<p>This woman certainly knew something&mdash;something
which, if revealed, would place me in possession
of the truth of what had actually occurred
at Harrington Gardens on that fatal night. If
she spoke she might clear Phrida of all
suspicion.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after a pause, I made up my mind
to try and clear up one point&mdash;that serious, crucial
point which had for days so obsessed me.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Petre," I said, "I wonder if you will
answer me a single question, one which does not
really affect the situation much. Indeed, as we are,
I hope, friends, I ask it more out of curiosity than
anything else."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" she asked, regarding me
strangely.</p>

<p>"I want to know whether, being a friend of
Digby's, you have ever met or ever heard of a
certain young lady living in Kensington named
Phrida Shand."</p>

<p>The effect of my words was almost electrical.
She sprung towards me, with fire in her big,
dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Phrida Shand!" she cried wildly, her white-gloved
hands again clenched. "Phrida Shand!
You know that woman, eh? You know her, Mr.
Royle. Is she a friend of yours?&mdash;or&mdash;or is she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
your enemy? Your friend, perhaps, because she
is pretty. Oh, yes!" she laughed, hysterically.
"Oh, yes! Of course, she is your friend. If she
is&mdash;then curse her, Mr. Royle&mdash;invoke all the curses
of hell upon her, as she so richly deserves!"</p>

<p>And from her lips came a peal of laughter that
was little short of demoniacal, while I stood glaring
at her in blank dismay.</p>

<p>What did she mean? Aye, what, indeed?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH AN ALLEGATION IS MADE.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">I stood</span> aghast at her words.</p>

<p>I strove to induce her to speak more openly,
and to tell me why I should not regard Phrida
as my friend.</p>

<p>But she only laughed mysteriously, saying:</p>

<p>"Wait, and you will see."</p>

<p>"You make a distinct charge against her, therefore
I think you ought to substantiate it," I said
in a tone of distinct annoyance.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Royle. Heed my words, I beg of
you."</p>

<p>"But, tell me, is Miss Shand the same person
as you have denounced as Digby's enemy?" I
asked in breathless apprehension. "Surely you
will tell me, Mrs. Petre, now that we are
friends."</p>

<p>"Ah! but are we friends?" she asked, looking
at me strangely beneath the light of the street-lamp
in that deserted thoroughfare, where all
was silence save the distant hum of the traffic.
The dark trees above stood out distinct against
the dull red night-glare of London, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
mysterious woman stood before me uttering that
query.</p>

<p>"Because we are mutual friends of Sir Digby's.
I hope I may call you a friend," I replied, as calmly
as I was able.</p>

<p>She paused for a moment in indecision. Then
she said:</p>

<p>"You admit that you are friendly with the girl
Shand&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"More than friendly, I wonder?" she asked in
a sharp tone.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'll be perfectly frank," was my answer.
"I am engaged to be married to her."</p>

<p>"Married," she gasped, "to her! Are you mad,
Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"I think not," I answered, greatly surprised at her
sudden attitude. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because," she replied in a low,
earnest voice, scarce above a whisper, "because,
before you take such a step make further
inquiry."</p>

<p>"Inquiry about what?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"About&mdash;well, about what has occurred at
Harrington Gardens."</p>

<p>"Then you know!" I cried. "You know the
truth, Mrs. Petre?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied quite calmly. "I know
from this letter what must have occurred there.
But who killed the girl I cannot say."</p>

<p>"Who was the girl they found dead?" I asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Ah! How can I tell? I did not see
her."</p>

<p>In a few quick words I described the deceased,
but either she did not recognise her from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
description, or she refused to tell me. In any case,
she declared herself in ignorance.</p>

<p>The situation was galling and tantalising. I
was so near discovering the truth, and yet my
inquiries had only plunged me more deeply into
a quagmire of suspicion and horror. The more I
tried to extricate myself the deeper I sank.</p>

<p>"But whoever the poor girl may have been,
you still maintain that Phrida Shand was Digby's
most deadly enemy?" I asked quickly, setting a
trap for her.</p>

<p>I took her unawares, and she fell into it.</p>

<p>"Yes," was her prompt response. An instant
later, however, realising how she had been led to
make an allegation which she had not intended,
she hastened to correct herself, saying: "Ah, no!
Of course, I do not allege that. I&mdash;I only
know that Digby was acquainted with her, and
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked slowly, when she
paused.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that he regretted the acquaintanceship."</p>

<p>"Regretted? Why?"</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders. All along
she had been cognisant of the tragedy, yet with
her innate cleverness she had not admitted her
knowledge.</p>

<p>"A man often regrets his friendship with a
woman," she said, with a mysterious air.</p>

<p>"What!" I cried fiercely. "Do you make
an insinuation that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Royle," she laughed, "I make
no insinuation. It was you who have endeavoured
to compel me to condemn her as Digby's enemy.
You yourself suggested it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you have told me that his fiercest and
most bitter enemy was a woman!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But I have not told you that
woman's name, nor do I intend to break my vow
of secrecy to Digby&mdash;fugitive that he may be at
this moment. Yet, depend upon it, he will return
and crush his enemies in the dust."</p>

<p>"I hope he will," was my fervent reply. "Yet
I love Phrida Shand, and upon her there rests a
terrible cloud of suspicion."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, still standing
beneath the lamp, gazing at me with those big,
dark eyes.</p>

<p>At last she said:</p>

<p>"The way out is quite easy."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"If you have any regard for your future put
your love aside," was her hard response.</p>

<p>"You hate her!" I said, knitting my brows, yet
recollecting the proof I had secured of her presence
in Digby's flat.</p>

<p>"Yes," was her prompt response. "I hate her&mdash;I
have cause to hate her!"</p>

<p>"What cause?"</p>

<p>"That is my own affair, Mr. Royle&mdash;my own
secret. Find Digby, and he will, no doubt, tell
you the truth."</p>

<p>"The truth concerning Phrida?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But he knew I was engaged to her! Why
did he not speak?"</p>

<p>"And expose her secret?" she asked.
"Would he have acted as a gentleman had he
done so? Does a man so lightly betray a woman's
honour?"</p>

<p>"A woman's honour!" I gasped, staring at her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
staggered as though she had struck me a blow.
"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean nothing," was her cold reply. "Take
it as you may, Mr. Royle, only be warned."</p>

<p>"But if Digby knew that she was worthless,
he would surely have made some remark to arouse
my suspicion?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why should he?" she queried. "A true
gentleman does not usually expose a woman's
secret."</p>

<p>I saw her point, and my heart sank within me.
Were these scandalous allegations of hers based
upon truth, or was she actuated by ill-feeling,
perhaps, indeed, of jealousy?</p>

<p>We walked on again slowly until we reached St.
James's Palace, and passed out into the end of
Pall Mall, where it joined St. James's Street. Yet
her attitude was one of complete mystery. I was
uncertain whether the admission she had so
unconsciously made regarding Phrida&mdash;that she
was Digby's worst enemy&mdash;was the actual truth
or not.</p>

<p>One thing was plain. This Mrs. Petre was a
clever, far-seeing woman of the world, who had
with great ingenuity held from me her knowledge of
the crime.</p>

<p>A problem was, therefore, presented to me. By
what means could she be aware of it? First, she
had expected to meet Digby that evening;
secondly, the letter I had brought was
written before the assassination of the unknown
girl.</p>

<p>How could she have obtained knowledge of
the affair if it were not premeditated and
hinted at in the letter I had so faithfully
delivered?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Half way up St. James's Street my companion
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I must be going! Would you please hail me
a taxi, Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;when you have answered my question,"
I said, with great politeness.</p>

<p>"I have already replied to it," was her response.
"You love Phrida Shand, but if you have any
self-respect, any regard for your future, break off
Whatever infatuation she has exercised over you.
If you are Digby's friend, you will be a man, and
act as such!"</p>

<p>"I really don't follow you," I said, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But surely my words are plain
enough!"</p>

<p>"Is she the enemy of Digby, of whom you
have spoken?"</p>

<p>"That question I am not permitted to answer."</p>

<p>I was silent a few seconds. Then I asked
earnestly:</p>

<p>"Tell me openly and frankly, Mrs. Petre. Is
she the person you suspect of having committed
the crime?"</p>

<p>She gave vent to a short dry laugh.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Royle," she exclaimed, "you
put to me the most difficult riddles. How can I
possibly suspect anyone of a crime of which I know
nothing, and of which even the papers appear
to be in ignorance?"</p>

<p>"But you are not in ignorance," I said. "How,
pray, did you learn that a tragedy had
occurred?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she laughed. "That is my secret.
You were very careful not to tell me the true cause
of poor Digby's flight. Yes, Mr. Royle, I congratulate
you upon your ingenuity in protecting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
honour of your friend. Rest assured he will not
forget the great services you have already rendered
him."</p>

<p>"I look for no reward. He was my friend,"
was my reply.</p>

<p>"Then, if he was your friend and you are
still his, heed my warning concerning Phrida
Shand."</p>

<p>"But tell me what you know?" I cried, clutching
her arm as we walked together. "You don't understand
that you are making allegations&mdash;terrible
allegations&mdash;against the woman I love dearest in
all the world. You have made an assertion, and
I demand that you shall substantiate it," I added in
frantic anxiety.</p>

<p>She shook off my hand angrily, declaring that
nothing more need be said, and adding that if I
refused to heed her, then the peril would be
mine.</p>

<p>"But you shall not leave me until you have
furnished me with proof of these perfidious actions
of my love!" I declared vehemently.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, we really cannot use high words
in the public street," she replied in a low tone of
reproof. "I am sorry that I am not permitted
to say more."</p>

<p>"But you shall!" I persisted. "Tell me&mdash;what
do you know? Is Digby the real Sir Digby?"</p>

<p>"Of course he is!"</p>

<p>"And what are his exact relations with
Phrida?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she laughed. "You had better ask
her yourself, Mr. Royle. She will, no doubt, tell you.
Of course, she will&mdash;well, if you are to marry her.
But there, I see that you are not quite responsible
for your words this evening. It is, perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
natural in the circumstances; therefore I will forgive
you."</p>

<p>"Natural!" I echoed. "I should think it is
natural that I should resent such dastardly
allegations when made against the woman I
love."</p>

<p>"All I repeat is&mdash;go and ask her for yourself,"
was the woman's quiet response as she drew herself
up, and pulled her fur more closely about her
throat. "I really can't be seen here talking with
you in that garb," she added.</p>

<p>"But you must tell me," I persisted.</p>

<p>"I can tell you no more than I have done. The
girl you love will tell you everything, or&mdash;at least,
if you have a grain of ingenuity, as you no
doubt have&mdash;you will find out everything for
yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah! but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not another word, please, Mr. Royle&mdash;not
to-night. If after making inquiry into the
matter you care to come and see me when I am back
in Park Mansions, I shall be very happy to receive
you. By that time, however, I hope we shall have
had news of poor Digby's whereabouts."</p>

<p>"If I hear from him&mdash;as I expect to&mdash;how can I
communicate with you?" I asked.</p>

<p>For a few seconds she stood wondering.</p>

<p>"Write to me to Park Mansions," she replied.
"My letters are always forwarded."</p>

<p>And raising her umbrella she herself hailed a
passing taxi.</p>

<p>"Remember my warning," were her final words
as she gave the man an address in Regent's Park,
and entered the conveyance. "Go and see Phrida
Shand at once and tell her what I have said."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I mention your name?" I asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "Good-night."</p>

<p>And a moment later I was gazing at the red back-lamp
of the taxi, while soon afterwards I again
caught a glimpse of the same lonely seller of shawls
whom I had seen at the Tube station, trudging
wearily homeward, there being no business doing
at that hour of the evening.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>PHRIDA MAKES CONFESSION.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">I sat</span> in my rooms in Albemarle Street utterly
bewildered.</p>

<p>My meeting with the mysterious woman who wore
the spray of mimosa had, instead of assisting to
clear up the mystery, increased it a hundredfold.</p>

<p>The grave suspicions I had entertained of Phrida
had been corroborated by her strangely direct insinuations
and her suggestion that I should go to
her and tell her plainly what had been alleged.</p>

<p>Therefore, after a sleepless night, I went to
Cromwell Road next morning, determined to know
the truth. You can well imagine my state of
mind when I entered Mrs. Shand's pretty morning-room,
where great bowls of daffodils lent colour
to the otherwise rather dull apartment.</p>

<p>Phrida entered, gay, fresh, and charming, in a
dark skirt and white blouse, having just risen
from breakfast.</p>

<p>"Really, Teddy," she laughed, "you ought to
be awarded a prize for early rising. I fear I'm
horribly late. It's ten o'clock. But mother and I
went last night to the Aldwych, and afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
with the Baileys to supper at the Savoy. So I may
be forgiven, may I not&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear," I replied, placing my hand
upon her shoulder. "What are you doing to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm quite full up with engagements," she
replied, crossing to the writing-table and consulting a
porcelain writing tablet.</p>

<p>"I'm due at my dressmaker's at half-past eleven,
then I've to call in Mount Street at half-past twelve,
lunch at the Berkeley, where mother has two women
to lunch with her, and a concert at Queen's Hall
at three&mdash;quite a day, isn't it?" she laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "You are very busy&mdash;too busy
even to talk seriously with me&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Talk seriously!" she echoed, looking me
straight in the face. "What do you mean, Teddy?
Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing very much, dearest," was my
reply, for I was striving to remain calm, not withstanding
my great anxiety and tortured mind.</p>

<p>"But there is," she persisted, clutching at my
hand and looking eagerly into my face. "What is
amiss? Tell me," she added, in low earnestness.</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment, and leaving her I
crossed to the window and gazed out into the broad,
grey thoroughfare, grim and dispiriting on that
chilly January morning.</p>

<p>For a moment I held my breath, then, with
sudden determination, I walked back to where she
was standing, and placing both hands upon her
shoulders, kissed her passionately upon the lips.</p>

<p>"You are upset to-day, Teddy," she said,
with deep concern. "What has happened? Tell
me, dear."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hardly know what's happened," I replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in a low voice. "But, Phrida," I said, looking
straight into her great eyes, "I want to&mdash;to ask you
a question."</p>

<p>"A question&mdash;what?" she demanded, her cheeks
paling slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I want you to tell me what you know
of a Mrs. Petre, a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Petre!" she gasped, stepping back
from me, her face pale as death in an instant.
"That woman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that woman, Phrida. Who is she&mdash;what
is she?"</p>

<p>"Please don't ask me, Teddy," my love cried in
distress, covering her pretty face with her hands
and bursting suddenly into tears.</p>

<p>"But I must, Phrida&mdash;I must, for my own peace
of mind," I said.</p>

<p>"Why? Do you know the woman?"</p>

<p>"I met her last night," I explained. "I delivered
to her a note which my friend Digby had
entrusted to me."</p>

<p>"I thought your friend had disappeared?" she
said quickly.</p>

<p>"It was given to me before his flight," was my
response. "I fulfilled a confidential mission with
which he entrusted me. And&mdash;and I met her.
She knows you&mdash;isn't that so?"</p>

<p>I stood with my eyes full upon the white face
of the woman I loved, surveying her coldly and
critically, so full of black suspicion. Was my
heart at that moment wholly hers? In imagination,
place yourself, my reader, in a similar position.
Put before yourself the problem with which, at that
second, I found myself face to face.</p>

<p>I loved Phrida, and yet had I not obtained proof
positive of her clandestine visit to my friend on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
that fateful night? Were her finger-prints not
upon the little glass-topped specimen-table in his
room?</p>

<p>And yet so clever, so ingenious had she been,
so subtle was her woman's wit, that she had never
admitted to me any knowledge of him further than
a formal introduction I had once made long ago.</p>

<p>I had trusted her&mdash;aye, trusted her with all the
open sincerity of an honourable man&mdash;for I loved
her better than anything else on earth. And with
what result?</p>

<p>With my own senses of smell and of hearing I had
detected her presence on the stairs&mdash;waiting, it
seemed, to visit my friend in secret after I had
left.</p>

<p>No doubt she had been unaware of my identity
as his visitor, or she would never dared to have
lurked there.</p>

<p>As I stood with my hand tenderly upon her arm,
the gaze of my well-beloved was directed to the
ground. Guilt seemed written upon her white
brow, for she dared not raise her eyes to mine.</p>

<p>"Phrida, you know that woman&mdash;you can't
deny knowledge of her&mdash;can you?"</p>

<p>She stood like a statue, with her hands clenched,
her mouth half open, her jaws fixed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't know what you mean," she
faltered at last, in a hard voice quite unusual
to her.</p>

<p>"I mean that I have a suspicion, Phrida&mdash;a
horrible suspicion&mdash;that you have deceived me,"
I said.</p>

<p>"How?" she asked, with her harsh, forced laugh.</p>

<p>I paused. How should I tell her? How should
I begin?</p>

<p>"You have suppressed from me certain knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of which you know I ought to have been in possession
for my friend Digby's sake, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! Digby Kemsley again!" she cried impatiently.
"You've not been the same to me
since that man disappeared."</p>

<p>"Because you know more concerning him than
you have ever admitted to me, Phrida," I said in
a firm, earnest voice, grasping her by the arm and
whispering into her ear. "Now, be open and frank
with me&mdash;tell me the truth."</p>

<p>"Of what?" she faltered, raising her eyes to
mine with a frightened look.</p>

<p>"Of what Mrs. Petre has told me."</p>

<p>"That woman! What has she said against
me?" my love demanded with quick resentment.</p>

<p>"She is not your friend, in any case," I
said slowly.</p>

<p>"My friend!" she echoed. "I should think not.
She&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And my love's little hands clenched themselves
and she burst again into tears without concluding
her sentence.</p>

<p>"I know, dearest," I said, striving to calm her,
and stroking her hair from her white brow. "I
tell you at once that I do not give credence to any
of her foul allegations, only&mdash;well, in order to
satisfy myself, I have come direct to you to hear
your explanation."</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my explanation!" she gasped, placing
her hand to her brow and bowing her head. "Ah!
what explanation can I make of allegations I have
never heard?" she demanded. "Surely, Teddy,
you are asking too much."</p>

<p>I grasped her hand, and holding it in mine gazed
again upon her. We were standing together near
the centre of the room where the glowing fire shed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a genial warmth and lit up the otherwise gloomy
and solemn apartment.</p>

<p>Ah! how sweet she seemed to me, how dainty,
how charming, how very pure. And yet? Ah!
the recollection of that woman's insinuations
on the previous night ate like a canker-worm
into my heart. And yet how I loved the pale,
agitated girl before me! Was she not all the world
to me?</p>

<p>A long and painful silence had fallen between
us, a silence only broken by the whirl of a taxi
passing outside and the chiming of the long, old-fashioned
clock on the stairs.</p>

<p>At last I summoned courage to say in a calm,
low voice;</p>

<p>"I am not asking too much, Phrida. I am only
pressing you to act with your usual honesty, and
tell me the truth. Surely you can have nothing
to conceal?"</p>

<p>"How absurd you are, Teddy!" she said in
her usual voice. "What can I possibly have
to conceal from you?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I said; "but you have already
concealed from me certain very important facts
concerning my friend Digby."</p>

<p>"Who has told you that? The woman Petre, I
suppose," she cried in anger. "Very well, believe
her, if you wish."</p>

<p>"But I don't believe her," I protested.</p>

<p>"Then why ask me for an explanation?"</p>

<p>"Because one is, I consider, due from you in
the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Then you have set yourself up to be my judge,
have you?" she asked, drawing herself up proudly,
all traces of her tears having vanished. I saw that
the attitude she had now assumed was one of de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>fiance;
therefore I knew that if I were to obtain
the information I desired I must act with greatest
discretion.</p>

<p>"No, Phrida," I answered. "I do not mistrust
or misjudge you. All I ask of you is the
truth. What do you know of my friend Digby
Kemsley?"</p>

<p>"Know of him&mdash;why, nothing&mdash;except that you
introduced us."</p>

<p>For a second I remained silent. Then with severity
I remarked:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I think you rather misunderstood
my question. I meant to ask whether
you have ever been to his flat in Harrington
Gardens?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," she cried instantly. "That woman
Petre has endeavoured to set you against me,
Teddy, because I love you. She has invented
some cruel lie or other, just as she did in another
case within my knowledge. Come," she added,
"tell me out plainly what she has alleged
against me?"</p>

<p>She was very firm and resolute now, and I saw
in her face a hard, defiant expression&mdash;an expression
of bitter hatred against the woman who had
betrayed her.</p>

<p>"Well," I said; "loving you as intensely as
I do, I can hardly bring myself to repeat her
insinuations."</p>

<p>"But I demand to know them," she protested,
standing erect and facing me. "I am attacked;
therefore, I am within my right to know what
charges the woman has brought against me."</p>

<p>"She has brought no direct charges," was my
slow reply. "But she has suggested certain things&mdash;certain
scandalous things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are they?" she gasped, suddenly pale
as death.</p>

<p>"First tell me the truth, Phrida," I cried, holding
her in my arms and looking straight into those
splendid eyes I admired so much. "Admit it&mdash;you
knew Digby. He&mdash;he was a friend of
yours?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a friend&mdash;" she gasped, half choking with
emotion. "A&mdash;friend&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"You knew him intimately. You visited him at
his rooms unknown to me!" I went on fiercely.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she shrieked. "Don't torture me like
this, Teddy, when I love you so deeply. You don't
know&mdash;you can never know all I have suffered&mdash;and
now this woman has sought to ruin and
crush me!"</p>

<p>"Has she spoken the truth when she says that
you visited Digby&mdash;at night&mdash;in secret!" I demanded,
bitterly, between my teeth, still holding
her, her white, hard-set face but a few inches
from my own.</p>

<p>She drew a long, deep breath, and in her eyes
was a strange half-fascinated look&mdash;a look that I
had never seen in them before.</p>

<p>"Ah! Teddy," she gasped. "This&mdash;this is the
death of all our love. I foresee only darkness and
ruin before me. But I will not lie to you. No!
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she paused, and a shudder ran through her
slim frame which I held within my grasp. "I'll
tell you the truth. Yes. I&mdash;I&mdash;went to see your
friend unknown to you."</p>

<p>"You did!" I cried hoarsely, with fierce anger
possessing my soul.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she faltered in a voice so low that
I could scarce catch her reply. "Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
there," she faltered, "because&mdash;because he&mdash;he
compelled me."</p>

<p>"Compelled you!" I echoed in blank dismay.</p>

<p>But at that instant I saw that the blackness of
unconsciousness had fallen upon my love even as I
held her in my embrace.</p>

<p>And for me, too, alas! the sun of life had ceased
to shine, and the world was dead.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FUGITIVE'S SECRET.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">Tenderly</span> I placed my love upon the couch, and
then rang the bell.</p>

<p>In answer to my summons the young Italian
man-servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Send Mallock here quickly," I said. "Miss
Shand is not well. But say nothing of this to
your mistress, or to the other servants. You
understand, Egisto?"</p>

<p>"Cer-tainly, sare," replied the smart young
Tuscan, and a few moments later the door re-opened
to admit the thin-faced maid in black, wearing her
muslin apron and gold-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p>She dashed across to the couch in an instant,
and bent, looking into the white, immobile face of
my well-beloved.</p>

<p>"I fear your mistress has fainted, Mallock, so I
thought it best to call you. I have, unfortunately,
imparted to her some news which has upset her.
Will you please see after her?"</p>

<p>"Of course, sir. I'll go and get some smelling
salts and some water."</p>

<p>And quickly the girl disappeared. Then, when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
had gone, I stood before the inanimate form of
the woman I loved so well, and wondered what could
be the real, actual truth.</p>

<p>Her admission had taken me aback. She had
confessed to visiting my friend, but had alleged
that he had compelled her. Was she actually
beneath some mysterious thraldom&mdash;was she held
in some secret bondage by the man I had trusted
and who was my best friend?</p>

<p>The very suspicion of it filled me with a
fierce irresponsible anger, and I clenched my
fists.</p>

<p>Ah! I would find him and face him. I would
clutch his throat and force the truth from his
lips.</p>

<p>And if he had betrayed me&mdash;if he had exercised
any evil influence over Phrida&mdash;then, by heaven!
I would take his life!</p>

<p>Mallock bustled in the next moment, and sinking
upon her knees began to apply restoratives.</p>

<p>"Tell your mistress that I will return after
luncheon, if she will see me," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and tell her, Mallock, to remain calm until
I see her. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the maid, and then I went
out into the hall, struggled into my overcoat, and
left the house.</p>

<p>Out in Cromwell Road the scene, grey, dull
and dismal, was, alas! in accord with my own
feelings.</p>

<p>The blow I had feared had fallen. The terrible
suspicion I had held from that moment when, upon
the stairs at Harrington Gardens, I had smelt that
sweet, unusual perfume and heard the jingle of
golden bangles, had been proved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>She had actually admitted her presence there&mdash;with
the man I had believed to be my friend, the
man, whom, up to the present, I had sought to
shield and protect!</p>

<p>I hailed a taxi, and not knowing what I did, drove
to the Reform. As I passed up the steps from
Pall Mall the porter handed me my letters, and then,
heedless of where my footsteps carried me, I entered
the big, square hall and turned into the writing-room
on the left&mdash;a room historic in the annals of British
politics, for many a State secret had been discussed
there by Ministers of the Crown, many a point of
the Cabinet's policy had been decided, and also the
fate of many a bill.</p>

<p>The long, sombre room with the writing tables
covered with blue cloth, was empty, as it usually is,
and I flung myself down to scribble a note&mdash;an
apology for not keeping an appointment that
afternoon.</p>

<p>My overburdened heart was full of chagrin and
grief, for my idol had been shattered by a single
blow, and only the wreck of all my hopes and
aspirations now remained.</p>

<p>In a week's time the coroner would hold his
adjourned inquiry into the tragedy at Harrington
Gardens, and then what startling revelations
might be made! By that time it was
probable that the police would be able to establish
the identity of the accused, and, moreover,
with Mrs. Petre vengeful and incensed against
Phrida, might she not make a statement to the
authorities?</p>

<p>If so, what then?</p>

<p>I sat with my elbows upon the table staring out
into Pall Mall, which wore such a cold and cheerless
aspect that morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>What could I do? How should I act? Ah!
yes, at that moment I sat utterly bewildered, and
trying in vain to discern some way out of that
maze of mystery.</p>

<p>I had not looked at the unopened letters beneath
my hand, but suddenly chancing to glance at
them, I noticed one in an unfamiliar feminine
handwriting.</p>

<p>I tore it open carelessly, expecting to find some
invitation or other, when, within, I found three
hastily scrawled lines written on the notepaper
of the Great Eastern Hotel at Liverpool Street.
It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Since I saw you something has happened.
Can you meet me again as soon as possible?
Please wire me, Mrs. Petre, Melbourne House,
Colchester."</p></div>

<p>I gazed at the note in extreme satisfaction. At
least, I had the woman's address. Yes, after I had
again seen Phrida I would see her and force from
her lips the truth.</p>

<p>I rose quickly, placed the other letters in my
pocket without opening them, and drove down to
the City, where I was compelled to keep a business
appointment.</p>

<p>At half-past three Egisto admitted me to Mrs.
Shand's, and in reply to my question, told me that
the "Signorina," as he always called Phrida, was
in the morning-room.</p>

<p>Dressed in a pale grey gown, relieved with
lace at the collar and wrists, she rose slowly
from a big armchair as I entered, and came
across to me, her face pale, drawn, and
anxious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! dearest," I cried. "I'm glad to see
you better. Are you quite yourself again
now?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thanks," was her low, rather weak reply.
"I&mdash;I felt very unwell this morning. I&mdash;I don't
know what was the matter." Then clinging to me
suddenly, she added, "Ah! forgive me, Teddy,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive, dear," was my
reply, as, placing my arm tenderly about her slim
waist, I looked into the depths of those wonderful
dark eyes of hers, trying to fathom what secret
lay hidden there.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she ejaculated. "I know, dear, that
though you affect to have forgiven me&mdash;that
you have not. How could you possibly forgive?"</p>

<p>"I am not angry with you in the least, Phrida!"
I assured her quite calmly. "Because you
have not yet told me the truth. I am here to
learn it."</p>

<p>"Yes," she gasped, sinking into a chair and
staring straight into the fire. The short winter's
day was dying, and already the light had nearly
faded. But the fire threw a mellow glow upon
her pale, hard-set features, and she presented a
strangely dramatic picture as she sat there with
head bent in shame. "Ah! yes. You are
here again to torture me, I suppose," she sighed
bitterly.</p>

<p>"I have no desire in the least to torture
you," I said, standing erect before her. "But I
certainly think that some explanation of your
conduct is due to me&mdash;the man whom you are to
marry."</p>

<p>"Marry!" she echoed in a blank voice, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
shrug of her shoulders, her eyes still fixed upon
the fire.</p>

<p>"Yes, marry," I repeated. "You made an
admission to me this morning&mdash;one of which
any man would in such circumstances demand
explanation. You said that my friend had
forced you to go to Harrington Gardens. Tell
me why? What power does that man hold over
you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no! Teddy!" she cried, starting wildly
to her feet. "No, no!" she protested, grasping my
hands frantically. "Don't ask that question.
Spare me that! Spare me that, for the sake of
the love you once bore for me."</p>

<p>"No. I repeat my question," I said slowly, but
very determinedly.</p>

<p>"Ah! no. I&mdash;I can't answer it. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For a few moments a silence fell between us.</p>

<p>Then I said in a low, meaning tone:</p>

<p>"You can't answer it, Phrida, because you are
ashamed, eh?"</p>

<p>She sprang upon me in an instant, her face full
of resentful fire.</p>

<p>"No!" she declared vehemently. "I am
not ashamed&mdash;only I&mdash;I cannot tell you the
reason I went to Harrington Gardens. That's
all."</p>

<p>"Yours is, to say the least, a rather thin excuse,
is it not?" I asked.</p>

<p>"What else can I say? Simply I can tell you
nothing."</p>

<p>"But you admit that you went to Harrington
Gardens. Did you go more than once?" I asked
very quietly.</p>

<p>She nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"And the last occasion was on the night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
when my friend was forced to fly, eh?" I suggested.</p>

<p>I saw that she was about to elude answering
my question. Therefore, I added:</p>

<p>"I already know you were there. I have
established your presence beyond the shadow
of doubt. So you may just as well admit it."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do," she faltered, sinking again into
her chair and resting her elbows upon her
knees.</p>

<p>"You were there&mdash;you were present when the
crime was committed," I said, looking straight at
her as I stood before her with folded arms.</p>

<p>"Whoever has said that tells wicked lies," was
her quick response.</p>

<p>"You were in Digby's room that night&mdash;after
I left," I declared.</p>

<p>"How do you know."</p>

<p>"Because the police have photographs of your
finger-prints," was my quiet reply.</p>

<p>The effect of my words upon her was electrical.</p>

<p>"The police!" she gasped, her face instantly
pale as death. "Do they know?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Edwards is in possession of your
finger-prints," I replied briefly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then they will suspect me!" she shrieked
in despair. "Ah! Teddy! If you love me,
save me!"</p>

<p>And she flung herself wildly at my feet, clutching
my hands and raising her face to mine in
frantic appeal.</p>

<p>"For that very reason I have returned here
to you to-day, Phrida," I replied in a low tone
of sympathy. "If I can save you from being
implicated in this terrible affair, I will. But
you must tell me the whole truth from the start.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Then I may be able to devise a plan to ensure
your security."</p>

<p>And I slowly assisted her to her feet and led
her back to her chair.</p>

<p>She sat without moving or speaking for some
moments, gravely thinking. Then of a sudden,
she said in a hard, hoarse voice:</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't know, Teddy, what I have
suffered&mdash;how I have been the innocent victim
of a foul and dastardly plot. I&mdash;I was entrapped&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Entrapped!" I echoed. "By whom? Not
by Digby Kemsley? He was not the sort of
man."</p>

<p>"He is your friend, I know. But if you
knew the truth you would hate him&mdash;hate
him, with as deep and fierce a hatred as I do
now," she declared, with a strange look in her
great eyes.</p>

<p>"You told me he had forced you to go to his
flat."</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he wanted to tell me something&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To tell you what?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to explain&mdash;I can't tell you, Teddy."</p>

<p>"Because it would be betraying his secret&mdash;eh?"
I remarked with bitterness. "And,
yet, in the same breath you have told me
you hate him. Surely, this attitude of yours is
an unusual one&mdash;is it not? You cannot hate
him and strive to shield him at the same
moment!"</p>

<p>She paused for a second before replying. Then
she said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"I admit that my attitude towards your friend
is a somewhat strange one, but there are reasons&mdash;strong,
personal reasons of my own&mdash;which
prevent me revealing to you the whole of what
is a strange and ghastly story. Surely it will
suffice you to know that I did not conceal all
knowledge of your friend and call upon him in
secret all of my own free will. No, Teddy, I loved
you&mdash;and I still love you, dear&mdash;far too well for
that."</p>

<p>"I trusted you, Phrida, but you deceived
me," I replied, with a poignant bitterness in my
heart.</p>

<p>"Under compulsion. Because&mdash;&mdash;" and she
paused with a look of terror in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Because what?" I asked slowly, placing my
hand tenderly upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>She shrank from contact with me.</p>

<p>"No. I&mdash;I can't tell you. It&mdash;it's all too
terrible, too horrible!" she whispered hoarsely,
covering her white face with her hands. "I
loved you, but, alas! all my happiness, all the
joy of which I have so long dreamed, has slipped
away from me because of the one false step&mdash;my
one foolish action&mdash;of which I have so long
repented."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Phrida," I urged, in deep earnestness,
bending down to her. "Confide in me."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, with an air of determination.
"It is my own affair. I have acted foolishly and
must bear the consequences."</p>

<p>"But surely you will not sacrifice our love rather
than tell me the truth!" I cried.</p>

<p>Hot tears welled in her eyes, and I felt her frail
form tremble beneath my touch.</p>

<p>"Alas! I am compelled," she faltered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you refuse to tell me&mdash;you refuse to
explain why this man whom I believed to be
my friend, and to whom I have rendered many
services, has held you in his thraldom?" I
exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>REVEALS A FURTHER DECEPTION.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">My</span> love paused. She remained silent for a long
time. Then, with her head bowed, she faltered:</p>

<p>"Yes. I&mdash;I am compelled to refuse."</p>

<p>"Why compelled?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot tell you," she whispered hoarsely.
"I dare not."</p>

<p>"Dare not? Is your secret so terrible, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is all a mystery. I do not know the
truth myself," she replied. "I only know that I&mdash;that
I love you, and that now, because that woman
has spoken, I have lost you and am left to face the
world&mdash;the police&mdash;alone!"</p>

<p>"Have I not told you, dearest, that I will do my
best to protect and defend you if you will only
reveal the truth to me," I said.</p>

<p>"But I can't."</p>

<p>"You still wish to shield this blackguard who
has held you in secret in his hands?" I cried
in anger.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," she cried in despair. "I tell
you, Teddy, now&mdash;even if this is the last time we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
ever meet&mdash;that I love you and you alone. I have
fallen the victim of a clever and dastardly plot,
believe me, or believe me not. What I tell you is
the truth."</p>

<p>"I do believe you," I replied fervently. "But
if you love me, Phrida, as you declare, you will
surely reveal to me the perfidy of this man I
have trusted!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't now," she said in a voice of excuse.
"It is impossible. But you may know some day."</p>

<p>"You knew that I visited him on that fatal
night. Answer me?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. Then presently, in a low tone,
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Teddy, I knew. Ah!" she went on, her
face white and haggard. "You cannot know the
torture I have undergone&mdash;fearing that you might
be aware of my presence there. Each time I met
you I feared to look you in the face."</p>

<p>"Because your secret is a guilty one&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I fell into a trap, and I cannot extricate myself,"
she declared hoarsely. "Now that the police
know, there is only one way out for me," she added,
in a tone of blank despair. "I cannot face it&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;now
that I have lost your love, dear. I care
for naught more. My enemies will hound me to
my death!"</p>

<p>And she burst into a torrent of bitter tears.</p>

<p>"No, no," I answered her, placing my hand
tenderly upon her shoulder. "Reveal the truth
to me, and I will protect you and shield you from
them. At present, though the police are in possession
of your finger-prints, as being those of a person
who had entered the flat on that night, they have
no knowledge of your identity, therefore, dear, have
no fear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! but I am in peril!" she cried, and I felt
her shudder beneath my touch. "That woman&mdash;ah!&mdash;she
may tell the police!"</p>

<p>"What woman?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Petre, the woman who has already betrayed
me to you."</p>

<p>"Then she knows&mdash;she knows your secret?"
I gasped.</p>

<p>She bent her head slowly in the affirmative.</p>

<p>I saw in her eyes a look of terror and despair,
such as I had never before seen in the eyes of any
person before&mdash;a haunted, agonised expression
that caused my heart to go out in sympathy for
her&mdash;for even though she might be guilty&mdash;guilty
of that crime of vengeance, yet, after all, she was
mine and she possessed my heart.</p>

<p>"Is there no way of closing that woman's lips?"
I asked very slowly.</p>

<p>She was silent, for, apparently, the suggestion
had not before occurred to her. Of a sudden, she
looked up into my face earnestly, and asked:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Teddy. Will you promise me&mdash;promise
not to prejudge me?"</p>

<p>"I do not prejudge you at all, dearest," I declared
with a smile. "My annoyance is due to
your refusal to reveal to me anything concerning
the man who has falsely posed as my friend."</p>

<p>"I would tell you all, dearest," she assured me,
"but it is impossible. If I spoke I should only
further arouse your suspicions, for you would never
believe that I spoke the truth."</p>

<p>"Then you prefer that I should remain in ignorance,
and by doing so your own peril becomes
increased!" I remarked, rather harshly.</p>

<p>"Alas! my silence is imperative," was all she
would reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Again and again I pressed her to tell me the reason
of the evil influence held over her by the man who
was now a fugitive, but with the greatest ingenuity
she evaded my questions, afterwards declaring
that all my inquiries were futile. The secret was
hers.</p>

<p>"And so you intend to shield this man, Phrida,"
I remarked at last, in bitter reproach.</p>

<p>"I am not silent for his sake!" my love cried,
starting up in quick resentment. "I hate him too
much. No, I refuse to reveal the truth because
I am compelled."</p>

<p>"But supposing you were compelled to clear
yourself in a criminal court," I said. "Supposing
that this woman went to the police! What then?
You would be compelled to speak the truth."</p>

<p>"No. I&mdash;I'd rather kill myself!" she declared,
in frantic despair. "Indeed, that is what I intend
to do&mdash;now that I know I have lost you!"</p>

<p>"No, no," I cried. "You have not lost me,
Phrida. I still believe in your purity and honesty,"
I went on, clasping her passionately to my
heart, she sobbing bitterly the while. "I love
you and I still believe in you," I whispered into
her ear.</p>

<p>She heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>"Ah! I wonder if you really speak the truth?"
she murmured. "If I thought you still believed in
me, how happy I should be. I would face my
enemies, and defy them."</p>

<p>"I repeat, Phrida, that notwithstanding this
suspicion upon you, I love you," I said very
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Then you will not prejudge me!" she asked,
raising her tear-stained eyes to mine. "You will
not believe evil of me until&mdash;until I can prove to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
you the contrary. You will not believe what Mrs.
Petre has told you?" she implored.</p>

<p>"I promise, dearest, that I will believe nothing
against you," I said fervently, kissing her cold, hard
lips. "But cannot you, in return, assist me in
solving the mystery of Harrington Gardens. Who
was the girl found there? Surely you know?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I swear I don't," was her
quick reply, though her face was blanched to the
lips.</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Petre gave me to understand that you
knew her," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that woman!" she cried in anger. "She
has lied to you, as to the others. Have I not told
you that she is my most deadly enemy?"</p>

<p>"Then she may go to the police&mdash;who knows!
How can we close her mouth?"</p>

<p>My love drew a long breath and shook her head.
The light had faded, and only the fitful flames of
the fire illuminated the sombre room. In the
dark shadows she presented a pale, pathetic little
figure, her face white as death, her thin, delicate
hands clasped before her in dismay and despair.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea where Digby is at this
moment?" I asked her slowly, wondering whether
if he were an intimate friend he had let her know
his hiding-place.</p>

<p>"No. I have not the slightest idea," was her
faint reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! If only I could discover him I would
wring the truth from him," I exclaimed between
my teeth.</p>

<p>"And if you did so, I myself would be imperilled,"
she remarked. "No, Teddy, you must not do that
if&mdash;if you love me and would protect me."</p>

<p>"Why?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you went to him he would know that I had
spoken, and then he would fulfil the threats he has
so often made. No, you must not utter a single
word. You must, for my sake, still remain his
friend. Will you, dear?"</p>

<p>"After what you have told me!" I cried.
"Never!"</p>

<p>"But you must," she implored, grasping both
my hands in hers. "If he had the slightest suspicion
that I had admitted my friendship with him, he
would act as he has always declared he would."</p>

<p>"How would he act?"</p>

<p>"He would reveal something&mdash;he would bring
proofs that even you would consider irrefutable,"
she answered in a low, hard whisper. "No, dear,"
and her grip upon my hands tightened. "In any
case there only remains to me one course&mdash;to
end it all, for in any case, I must lose you. Your
confidence and love can never be restored."</p>

<p>"You must not speak like that," I said very
gravely. "I have not yet lost confidence in you,
Phrida. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I know how generous you are, dear,"
she interrupted, "but how can I conceal from myself
the true position? You have discovered that I
visited that man's flat clandestinely, that&mdash;that we
were friends&mdash;and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, not concluding her sentence, and
bursting again into tears, rushed from the room
before I could grasp and detain her.</p>

<p>I stood silent, utterly dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Were those words an admission of her guilt?</p>

<p>Was it by her hand, as that woman had insinuated,
the unknown girl's life had been taken?</p>

<p>I recollected the nature of the wound, as revealed
by the medical evidence, and I recalled that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
knife which was lying upon the table in the drawing-room
above.</p>

<p>Why did Phrida so carefully conceal from me the
exact truth concerning her friendship with the man
I had trusted? What secret power did he exercise
over her? And why did she fear to reveal anything
to me&mdash;even though I had assured her that my
confidence in her remained unshaken.</p>

<p>Was not guilt written upon that hard, white face?</p>

<p>I stood staring out of the window in blank indecision.
What I had all along half feared had
been proved. Between my love and the man of
whom I had never had the slightest suspicion,
some secret&mdash;some guilty secret&mdash;existed.</p>

<p>And even now, even at risk of losing my affection,
she was seeking to shield him!</p>

<p>My blood boiled within me, and I clenched
my fists as I strode angrily up and down that
dark room.</p>

<p>All her admissions came back to me&mdash;her frantic
appeal to me not to prejudge her, and her final and
out-spoken decision to take her own life rather than
reveal the truth.</p>

<p>What could it mean? What was the real solution
of that strange problem of crime in which, quite
unwittingly, I had become so deeply implicated?</p>

<p>I was passing the grate in pacing the room, as
I had already done several times, when my eyes fell
upon a piece of paper which had been screwed up
and flung there. Curiosity prompted me to pick
it out of the cinders, for it struck me that it must have
been thrown there by Phrida before I had entered
the room.</p>

<p>To my surprise I saw the moment I held it in my
hand that it was a telegram. Opening it carefully
I found that it was addressed to her, therefore she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
had no doubt cast it upon the fire when I had so
suddenly entered.</p>

<p>I read it, and stood open-mouthed and amazed.</p>

<p>By it the perfidy of the woman I loved, alas!
became revealed.</p>

<p>She had deceived me!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>AN EFFACED IDENTITY.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> telegram was signed with the initial "D."&mdash;Digby!</p>

<p>The words I read were&mdash;"Have discovered T
suspects. Exercise greatest care, and remember
your promise. We shall meet again soon."</p>

<p>The message showed that it had been handed
in at Brussels at one o'clock that afternoon.</p>

<p>Brussels! So he was hiding there. Yes, I would
lose no time in crossing to the gay little Belgian
capital and search him out.</p>

<p>Before giving him up to the police I would meet
him face to face and demand the truth. I would
compel him to speak.</p>

<p>Should I retain possession of the message? I
reflected. But, on consideration, I saw that
when I had left, Phrida might return to recover
it. If I replaced it where I had found it she
would remain in ignorance of the knowledge I had
gained.</p>

<p>So I screwed it up again and put it back among
the cinders in the grate, afterwards leaving the
house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning I stepped out upon the platform
of the great Gare du Nord in Brussels&mdash;a
city I knew well, as I had often been there
on business&mdash;and drove in a taxi along the
busy, bustling Boulevard Auspach to the Grand
Hotel.</p>

<p>In the courtyard, as I got out, the frock-coated
and urbane manager welcomed me warmly, for I
had frequently been his guest, and I was shown to
a large room overlooking the Boulevard where I
had a wash and changed.</p>

<p>Then descending, I called a taxi and immediately
began a tour of the various hotels where
I thought it most likely that the man I sought
might be.</p>

<p>The morning was crisp and cold, with a perfect
sky and brilliant sunshine, bright and cheerful
indeed after the mist and gloom of January in
London.</p>

<p>Somehow the aspect, even in winter, is always
brighter across the channel than in our much
maligned little island. They know not the "pea-souper"
on the other side of the Straits of
Dover, and the light, invigorating atmosphere
is markedly apparent directly one enters France
or Belgium.</p>

<p>The business boulevards, the Boulevarde
Auspach, and the Boulevard du Nord, with
their smart shops, their big caf&eacute;s, and their
hustling crowds, were bright and gay as my taxi
sped on, first to the M&eacute;tropole, in the Place
de Brouckere.</p>

<p>The name of Kemsley was unknown there. The
old concierge glanced at his book, shook his head,
and elevating his shoulders, replied:</p>

<p>"Non, m'sieur."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Thence I went to the Palace, in front of
the station, the great new hotel and one of
the finest in Europe, a huge, garish place
of gilt and luxury. But there I met with equal
success.</p>

<p>Then I made the tour of the tree-lined outer
boulevards, up past the Botanical Gardens and along
the Rue Royale, first to the Hotel de France, then
to the Europe, the Belle Vue, the Carlton in the
Avenue Louise, the new Wiltscher's a few doors
away, and a very noted English house from the
Boulevard Waterloo, as well as a dozen other
houses in various parts of the town&mdash;the Cecil
in the Boulevard du Nord, the Astoria in the Rue
Royale, and even one or two of the cheaper
pensions&mdash;the Dufour, De Boek's, and Nettell's,
but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>Though I spent the whole of that day making
investigations I met with no success.</p>

<p>Though I administered judicious tips to concierge
after concierge, I could not stir the
memory of a single one that within the past
ten days any English gentleman answering
the description I gave had stayed at their
establishment.</p>

<p>Until the day faded, and the street lamps
were lit, I continued my search, my taxi-driver
having entered into the spirit of my
quest, and from time to time suggesting other
and more obscure hotels of which I had never
heard.</p>

<p>But the reply was the same&mdash;a regretful "Non,
m'sieur."</p>

<p>It had, of course, occurred to me that if the
fugitive was hiding from the Belgian police, who
no doubt had received his description from Scot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>land
Yard, he would most certainly assume a
false name.</p>

<p>But I hoped by my minute description to be able
to stir the memory of one or other of the dozens
of uniformed hall-porters whom I interviewed.
The majority of such men have a remarkably
retentive memory for a face, due to long cultivation,
just as that possessed by one's club hall-porter,
who can at once address any of the thousand or so
members by name.</p>

<p>I confess, however, when at five o'clock,
I sat in the huge, noisy Caf&eacute; M&eacute;tropole over
a glass of coffee and a liqueur of cognac, I
began to realise the utter hopelessness of my
search.</p>

<p>Digby Kemsley was ever an evasive person&mdash;a
past master in avoiding observation, as I well
knew. It had always been a hobby of his, he
had told me, of watching persons without himself
being seen.</p>

<p>Once he had remarked to me while we had
been smoking together in that well-remembered
room wherein the tragedy had taken
place:</p>

<p>"I should make a really successful detective,
Royle. I've had at certain periods of my life to
efface myself and watch unseen. Now I've brought
it to a fine art. If ever circumstances make it imperative
for me to disappear&mdash;which I hope not,"
he laughed, "well&mdash;nobody will ever find me,
I'm positive."</p>

<p>These words of his now came back to me
as I sat there pensively smoking, and wondering
if, after all, I had better not return again
to London and remain patient for the additional
police evidence which would no doubt be forth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>coming
at the adjourned inquest in a week's
time.</p>

<p>I thought of the clever cunning exercised by
the girl whom I so dearly loved and in whose
innocence I had so confidently believed, of her
blank refusal to satisfy me, and alas! of her
avowed determination to shield the scoundrel
who had posed as my friend, and whom the
police had declared to be only a vulgar impostor.</p>

<p>My bitter reflection maddened me.</p>

<p>The jingle and chatter of that noisy caf&eacute;, full to
overflowing at that hour, for rain had commenced
to fall outside in the boulevard, irritated me. From
where I sat in the window I could see the crowds
of business people, hurrying through the rain to
their trams and trains&mdash;the neat-waisted little
modistes, the felt-hatted young clerks, the obese
and over-dressed and whiskered men from their
offices on the Bourse, the hawkers crying the
"Soir," and the "Derni&egrave;re Heure," with strident
voices, the poor girls with rusty shawls and
pinched faces, selling flowers, and the gaping,
idling Cookites who seem to eternally pass and
re-pass the M&eacute;tropole at all hours of the day and
the night.</p>

<p>Before my eyes was there presented the whole
phantasmagoria of the life of the thrifty, hard-working
Bruxellois, that active, energetic race which
the French have so sarcastically designated "the
brave Belgians."</p>

<p>After a lonely dinner in the big, glaring salle-&agrave;-manger,
at the Grand, I went forth again upon my
quest. That the fugitive had been in Brussels on
the previous day was proved by his telegram, yet
evasive as he was, he might have already left.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Yet I hoped he still remained in the capital, and if
so he would, I anticipated, probably go to one of
the music-halls or variety theatres. Therefore I
set out upon another round.</p>

<p>I strolled eagerly through the crowded promenade
of the chief music-hall of Brussels&mdash;the
Pole Nord, the lounge wherein men and women
were promenading, laughing, and drinking, but
I saw nothing of the man of whom I was in
search.</p>

<p>I knew that he had shaved off his beard and
otherwise altered his appearance. Therefore my
attention upon those about me was compelled to be
most acute.</p>

<p>I surveyed both stalls and boxes, but amid that
gay, well-dressed crowd I could discover nobody
the least resembling him.</p>

<p>From the Pole Nord I went to the Scala,
where I watched part of an amusing revue;
but my search there was likewise in vain, as
it was also at Olympia, the Capucines, and
the Folies Berg&egrave;res, which I visited in turn.
Then, at midnight, I turned my attention to
the big caf&eacute;s, wandering from the Bourse along
the Boulevard Auspach, entering each caf&eacute;
and glancing around, until at two o'clock in
the morning I returned to the Grand, utterly
fagged out by my long vigil of over fifteen
hours.</p>

<p>In my room I threw off my overcoat and flung
myself upon the bed in utter despair.</p>

<p>Until I met that man face to face I could not,
I saw, learn the truth concerning my love's friendship
with him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Petre had made foul insinuations, and
now that my suspicions had been aroused that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Phrida might actually be guilty of that terrible
crime at Harrington Gardens, the whole attitude of
my well-beloved seemed to prove that my suspicions
were well grounded.</p>

<p>Indeed, her last unfinished sentence as she had
rushed from the room seemed conclusive proof of
the guilty secret by which her mind was now
overburdened.</p>

<p>She had never dreamed that I held the
slightest suspicion. It was only when she knew
that the woman Petre had met me and had
talked with me that she saw herself betrayed.
Then, when I had spoken frankly, and told
her what the woman had said, she saw that
to further conceal her friendship with Digby was
impossible.</p>

<p>Every word she had spoken, every evasive sentence,
every protest that she was compelled to remain
silent, recurred to me as I lay there staring blankly
at the painted ceiling.</p>

<p>She had told me that she was unaware of
the fugitive's whereabouts, and yet not half
an hour before she had received a telegram
from him.</p>

<p>Yes, Phrida&mdash;the woman I trusted and loved
with such a fierce, passionate affection, had lied to
me deliberately and barefacedly.</p>

<p>But I was on the fellow's track, and cost what
it might in time, or in money, I did not intend to
relinquish my search until I came face to face
with him.</p>

<p>That night, as I tossed restlessly in bed, it
occurred to me that even though he might be in
Brussels, it was most probable in the circumstances
that he would exercise every precaution
in his movements, and knowing that the police were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in search of him, would perhaps not go forth in
the daytime.</p>

<p>Many are the Englishmen living "under a cloud"
in Brussels, as well as in Paris, and there is
not a Continental city of note which does not
contain one or more of those who have "gone
under" at home.</p>

<p>Seedy and down-at-heel, they lounge about the
caf&eacute;s and hotels frequented by English travellers.
Sometimes they sit apart, pretend to sip their cup
of coffee and read a newspaper, but in reality they
are listening with avidity to their own language
being spoken by their own people&mdash;poor, lonely,
solitary exiles.</p>

<p>Every man who knows the by-ways of the
Continent has met them often in far-off,
obscure towns, where they bury themselves in the
lonely wilderness of a drab back street and live
high-up for the sake of fresh air and that single
streak of sunshine which is the sole pleasure of their
broken, blighted lives.</p>

<p>Yes, the more I reflected, the more apparent
did it become that if the man whom Inspector
Edwards had declared to be a gross impostor
was still in the Belgian capital, he would most
probably be in safe concealment in one or other
of the cheaper suburbs.</p>

<p>But how could I trace him?</p>

<p>To go to the bureau of police and make a statement
would only defeat my own ends.</p>

<p>No; if I intended to learn the truth I must act
upon my own initiative. Official interference would
only thwart my own endeavours.</p>

<p>I knew Digby Kemsley. He was as shrewd
and cunning as any of the famous detectives,
whether in real life or in fiction. Therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to be a match for him, I would, I already
realised, be compelled to fight him with his own
weapons.</p>

<p>I did not intend that he should escape me
before he told me, with his own lips, the secret
of my well-beloved.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>REVEALS ANOTHER ENIGMA.</h3>


<p class="gap2">"<span class="smcap">The</span> identity of the victim has not yet been
established, sir."</p>

<p>These words were spoken to the coroner by
Inspector Edwards at the adjourned inquest held
on January the twenty-second.</p>

<p>Few people were in court, for, until the
present, the public had had no inkling as to
what had occurred on that fatal night in Harrington
Gardens. The first inquest had not been
"covered" by any reporter, as the police had
exercised considerable ingenuity in keeping the
affair a secret.</p>

<p>But now, at the adjourned inquiry, secrecy
was no longer possible, and the three reporters
present were full of inquisitiveness regarding
the evidence given on the previous occasion,
and listened with attention while it was being
read over.</p>

<p>Inspector Edwards, however, had dealt with
them in his usually genial manner, and by the
exercise of considerable diplomacy had succeeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in allaying their suspicions that there was any
really good newspaper "story" in connection
with it.</p>

<p>The medical witnesses were recalled, but neither
had anything to add to the depositions they had
already made. The deceased had been fatally
stabbed by a very keen knife with a blade of
peculiar shape. That was all.</p>

<p>The unknown had been buried, and all that remained
in evidence was a bundle of blood-stained
clothing, some articles of jewellery, a pair of
boots, hat, coat, gloves, and a green leather
vanity-bag.</p>

<p>"Endeavours had been made, sir, to trace
some of the articles worn by the deceased,
and also to establish the laundry marks on the
underclothing," the inspector went on, "but,
unfortunately, the marks have been pronounced
by experts to be foreign ones, and the whole
of the young lady's clothes appear to have
been made abroad&mdash;in France or Belgium, it
is thought."</p>

<p>"The laundry marks are foreign, eh?" remarked
the coroner, peering at the witness through
his pince-nez, and poising his pen in his hand.
"Are you endeavouring to make inquiry abroad
concerning them?"</p>

<p>"Every inquiry is being made, sir, in a dozen
cities on the continent. In fact, in all the
capitals."</p>

<p>"And the description of the deceased has been
circulated?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Photographs have been sent through
all the channels in Europe. But up to the present
we have met with no success," Edwards replied.
"There is a suspicion because of a name upon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
tab in the young girl's coat that she may be
Italian. Hence the most ardent search is being
made by the Italian authorities into the manner
and descriptions of females lately reported as
missing."</p>

<p>"The affair seems remarkably curious," said the
coroner. "It would certainly appear that the
lady who lost her life was a stranger to
London."</p>

<p>"That is what we believe, sir," Edwards
replied. Seated near him, I saw how keen and
shrewd was the expression upon his face. "We
have evidence that certain persons visited the
flat on the night in question, but these have
not yet been identified. The owner of the
flat has not yet been found, he having
absconded."</p>

<p>"Gone abroad, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"It would appear so, sir."</p>

<p>"And his description has been circulated also?"
asked the coroner.</p>

<p>"Yes, a detailed description, together with a
recent photograph," was Edwards' reply. Then
he added: "We have received this at Scotland
Yard, sir&mdash;an anonymous communication which
may or may not throw considerable light on
to the affair," and he handed a letter on blue
paper to the coroner, which the latter perused
curiously, afterwards passing it over to the foreman
of the jury.</p>

<p>"Rather remarkable!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then, when the jury had completed reading
the anonymous letter, addressing them, he
said:</p>

<p>"It is not for you, gentlemen, to regard that letter
in the light of evidence, but, nevertheless, it raises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
a very curious and mysterious point. The writer,
as you will note, is prepared to reveal the truth of
the whole affair in return for a monetary reward.
It is, of course, a matter to be left entirely at the
discretion of the police."</p>

<p>I started at this statement, and gazed across
the court&mdash;dull and cheerless on that cold
winter's afternoon.</p>

<p>Who had written that anonymous letter? Who
could it be who was ready to reveal the truth if paid
for doing so?</p>

<p>Was Phrida's terrible secret known?</p>

<p>I held my breath, and listened to the slow, hard
words of the coroner, as he again addressed some
questions to the great detective.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Edwards was saying. "There is
distinct evidence of the presence at the flat on the
night in question of some person&mdash;a woman
whose identity we have not yet been successful
in establishing. We, however, have formed a
theory which certainly appears to be borne out
by the writer of the letter I have just handed
you."</p>

<p>"That the unknown was struck down by the hand
of a woman&mdash;eh?" asked the Coroner, looking
sharply across at the Inspector, who briefly replied
in the affirmative, while I sat staring straight before
me, like a man in a dream.</p>

<p>I heard the Coroner addressing the jury in hard,
business-like tones, but I know not what he
said. My heart was too full to think of anything
else besides the peril of the one whom I
loved.</p>

<p>I know that the verdict returned by the jury
was one of "Wilful murder." Then I went out into
the fading light of that brief London day, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
seeking Edwards, walked at his side towards the
busy Kensington High Street.</p>

<p>We had not met for several days, and he, of
course, had no knowledge of my visit to Brussels.
Our greeting was a cordial one, whereupon I asked
him what was contained in the anonymous letter
addressed to "The Yard"?</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Royle. It's very curious," he said.
"The Coroner has it at this moment, or I'd show it
to you. The handwriting is a woman's, and it has
been posted at Colchester."</p>

<p>"At Colchester!" I echoed in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, why?" he asked, looking at me in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Only&mdash;well, Colchester is a
curious place for anyone to live who knows
the truth about an affair in Kensington," was
my reply, for fortunately I quickly recovered
myself.</p>

<p>"Why not Colchester as well as Clapham&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," I laughed. "But, tell me,
what does the woman say?"</p>

<p>"She simply declares that she can elucidate the
mystery and give us the correct clue&mdash;even bring
evidence if required&mdash;as to the actual person who
committed the crime, if we, on our part, will pay
for the information."</p>

<p>"And what shall you do?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know. The letter only arrived
this morning. To-morrow the Council of Seven
will decide what action we take."</p>

<p>"Does the woman give her name?" I asked
with affected carelessness.</p>

<p>"No. She only gives the name of 'G. Payne,'
and the address as 'The G.P.O., London.' She's
evidently a rather cute person."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"G. Payne"&mdash;the woman Petre without a
doubt.</p>

<p>I recollected her telegram asking me to meet her.
She had said that something had "happened,"
and she had urged me to see her as soon as
possible. Was it because I had not replied that
she had penned that anonymous letter to the
police?</p>

<p>The letter bore the Colchester post-mark, and
she, I knew, lived at Melbourne House in that
town.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will get into communication with
her," I exclaimed presently.</p>

<p>"Of course. Any line of action in the elucidation
of the mystery is worth trying. But what I cannot
quite understand is, why she requires blood-money,"
remarked the detective as we strolled together in
the arcaded entrance to the Underground Station
at High Street, Kensington. "I always look
askance at such letters. We receive many of
them at the Yard. Not a single murder mystery
comes before us, but we receive letters from
cranks and others offering to point out the guilty
person."</p>

<p>"But may not the writers of such letters be
endeavouring to fasten guilt upon perfectly
innocent persons against whom they have spite?"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"Ah! That's just it, Mr. Royle," exclaimed my
companion gravely. "Yet it is so terribly difficult
to discriminate, and I fear we often, in our hesitation,
place aside letters, the writers of which could really
give valuable information."</p>

<p>"But in this case, what are your natural inclinations?"
I asked. "I know that you possess a
curious, almost unique, intuition as to what is fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and what is fiction. What is, may I term it, your
private opinion?"</p>

<p>He halted against the long shop-windows of
Derry &amp; Toms, and paused for several minutes.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last in a deeply earnest
tone, "I tell you frankly, Mr. Royle, what
I believe. First, I don't think that the man
Kemsley, although an impostor, was the actual
assassin."</p>

<p>"Why?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I've very carefully studied the whole
problem. I've looked at it from every point of
view," he said. "I confess the one fact puzzles
me, that this man Kemsley could live so long
in London and pose as the dead Sir Digby if
he were not the actual man himself, has
amazed me! In his position as Sir Digby, the
great engineer, he must have met in society
many persons who knew him. We have evidence
that he constantly moved in the best circles
in Mayfair, and apparently without the slightest
compunction. Yet, in contradiction, we have
the remarkable fact that the real Sir Digby
died in South America in very mysterious and
tragic circumstances."</p>

<p>I saw that a problem was presented to Inspector
Edwards which sorely puzzled him, as it certainly
did myself.</p>

<p>"Well," I asked after a pause, and then with
some trepidation put the question, "what do you
intend doing?"</p>

<p>"Doing!" he echoed. "There is but one course
to pursue. We must get in touch with this woman
who says she knows the truth, and obtain what
information we can from her. Perhaps she can
reveal the identity of the woman whose fingers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
touched that glass-topped table in the room where
the crime was committed. If so, that will tell
us a great deal, Mr. Royle." Then, taking a
cigarette from his pocket and tapping it, he
added, "Do you know, I've been wondering of
late how it is that you got those finger-prints
which so exactly corresponded with the ones
which we secured in the flat. How did you
obtain them?"</p>

<p>His question non-plussed me.</p>

<p>"I had a suspicion," I replied in a faltering voice,
"and I tried to corroborate it."</p>

<p>"But you have corroborated it," he declared.
"Why, Mr. Royle, those prints you brought to the
Yard are a most important clue. Where did you
get them?"</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment, jostled by the crowd
of passers-by.</p>

<p>"Well," I said with a faint smile, realising what a
grave mistake I had made in inculpating my well-beloved,
"I simply made some experiments as an
amateur in solving the mystery."</p>

<p>"Yes, but those prints were the same as
those we got from the flat. Whence did they
come?"</p>

<p>"I obtained them upon my own initiative,"
I replied, with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>"But you must surely tell me, Mr. Royle,"
he urged quickly. "It's a most important
point."</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "I'm not a detective, remember.
I simply put to the test a suspicion I have entertained."</p>

<p>"Suspicion of what?"</p>

<p>"Whether my theory was correct or not."</p>

<p>"Whatever theory you hold, Mr. Royle, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
truth remains the same. I truly believe," he said,
looking hard at me, "namely that the unknown
victim was struck down by the hand which imprinted
the marks you brought to me&mdash;a woman's hand.
And if I am not mistaken, sir&mdash;you know the
identity of the guilty woman!"</p>

<h3>CONCERNS MRS. PETRE.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">Days</span>, weeks, passed, but I could obtain no further
clue. The month of March lengthened into April,
but we were as far as ever from a solution of the
mystery.</p>

<p>Since my return from Brussels I had, of course
seen Phrida many, many times, and though I had
never reverted again to the painful subject, yet her
manner and bearing showed only too plainly that
she existed in constant dread!</p>

<p>Her face had become thin and haggard, with
dark rings around her eyes and upon it was a wild,
hunted expression, which she strove to disguise,
but in vain.</p>

<p>She now treated me with a strange, cold indifference,
so unlike her real self, while her attitude
was one of constant attention and strained
alertness.</p>

<p>The woman Petre had apparently not been approached
by Scotland Yard, therefore as the days
went by I became more and more anxious to see her,
to speak with her&mdash;and, if necessary, to come to
terms with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, without a word to anyone, I one
evening caught the six o'clock train from Liverpool
Street, and before eight was eating my
dinner in the big upstairs room of The Cups
Hotel, while the hall-porter was endeavouring
to discover for me the whereabouts of Melbourne
House.</p>

<p>I had nearly finished my meal when the uniformed
servant entered, cap in hand, saying:</p>

<p>"I've found, sir, that the house you've been inquiring
for is out on the road to Marks Tey, about
a mile. An old lady named Miss Morgan lived
there for many years, but she died last autumn,
and the place has, they say, been let furnished to
a lady&mdash;a Mrs. Petre. Is that the lady you are
trying to find?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is," I replied, much gratified at the
man's success. Then, placing a tip in his palm, I
drank off my coffee, put on my overcoat, and
descended to the taxi which he had summoned
for me.</p>

<p>He gave directions to the driver, and soon we were
whirling along the broad streets of Colchester, and
out of the town on the dark, open road which led
towards London. Presently we pulled up, and
getting out, I found myself before a long, low, ivy-covered
house standing back behind a high hedge of
clipped box, which divided the small, bare front
garden from the road. Lonely and completely
isolated, it stood on the top of a hill with high,
leafless trees behind, and on the left a thick copse.
In front were wide, bare, open fields.</p>

<p>Opening the iron gate I walked up the gravelled
path to the door and rang. In a window on the
right a light showed, and as I listened I heard the
tramp of a man's foot upon the oilcloth of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
hall, and next moment the door was unlocked
and opened.</p>

<p>A tall, thin-faced young man of somewhat sallow
complexion confronted me. He had keen, deep-set
eyes, broad forehead, and pointed chin.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Petre at home?" I inquired briefly.</p>

<p>In a second he looked at me as though with
distrust, then apparently seeing the taxi waiting,
and satisfying himself that I was a person of respectability,
he replied in a refined voice:</p>

<p>"I really don't know, but I'll see, if you will step
in?" and he ushered me into a small room at the
rear of the house, a cosy but plainly-furnished little
sitting-room, wherein a wood fire burned with
pleasant glow.</p>

<p>I handed him my card and sat down to wait, in
the meanwhile inspecting my surroundings with
some curiosity.</p>

<p>Now, even as I recall that night, I cannot tell
why I should have experienced such a sense of grave
insecurity as I did when I sat there awaiting the
woman's coming. I suppose we all of us possess
in some degree that strange intuition of impending
danger. It was so with me that night&mdash;just as I
have on other occasions been obsessed by that
curious, indescribable feeling that "something is
about to happen."</p>

<p>There was about that house an air of mystery
which caused me to hesitate in suspicion. Whether
it was owing to its lonely position, to the heavy mantle
of ivy which hid its walls, to the rather weird and
unusual appearance of the young man who had
admitted me, or to the mere fact that I was there to
meet the woman who undoubtedly knew the truth
concerning the tragic affair, I know not. But I
recollect a distinct feeling of personal insecurity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew the woman I was about to meet to be a
cold, hard, unscrupulous person, who, no doubt,
held my love's liberty&mdash;perhaps her life&mdash;in the
hollow of her hand.</p>

<p>That horrifying thought had just crossed my mind
when my reflections were interrupted by the door
opening suddenly and there swept into the room
the lady upon whom I had called.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Royle!" she cried in warm welcome,
extending her rather large hand as she stood
before me, dressed quietly in black, relieved by a
scarlet, artificial rose in her waistband. "So
you've come at last. Ah! do you know I've
wanted to meet you for days. I expected you
would come to me the moment you returned from
Brussels."</p>

<p>I started, and stood staring at her without replying.
She knew I had been to Belgium. Yet, as far as I
was aware, nobody knew of my visit&mdash;not even
Haines.</p>

<p>"You certainly seem very well acquainted with
my movements, Mrs. Petre," I laughed.</p>

<p>But she only shrugged her shoulders. Then
she said:</p>

<p>"I suppose there was no secrecy regarding your
journey, was there?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," I replied. "I had business
over there, as I very often have. My firm do a big
business in Belgium and Holland."</p>

<p>She smiled incredulously.</p>

<p>"Did your business necessitate your visiting
all the hotels and music-halls?"</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" I asked in quick
surprise.</p>

<p>But she only pursed her lips, refusing to give me
satisfaction. I saw that I must have been watched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>&mdash;perhaps
by Digby himself. The only explanation
I could think of was that he, with his clever
cunning, had watched me, and had written to
this woman, his accomplice, telling her of my
search.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't betray the source of your information
if you consider it so indiscreet," I said with sarcasm
a few moments later. "I came here, Mrs. Petre,
in response to your invitation. You wished to
see me?"</p>

<p>"I did. But I fear it is now too late to avert
what I had intended," was her quiet response.
The door was closed, the room was silent, and we
were alone.</p>

<p>Seated in an armchair the woman leaned back
and gazed at me strangely from beneath her long,
half-closed lashes, as though undecided what she
should say. I instantly detected her hesitation,
and said:</p>

<p>"You told me in your message that something
unexpected had occurred. What is it? Does it
concern our mutual friend, Digby?"</p>

<p>"Friend!" she echoed. "You call him your
friend, and yet at the same time you have been
in search of him, intending to betray him to the
police!"</p>

<p>"Such was certainly not my intention," I declared
firmly. "I admit that I have endeavoured to
find him, but it was because I wished to speak
with him."</p>

<p>"Ah! of course," she sneered. "That girl Shand
has, perhaps, made a statement to you, and now you
want to be inquisitive, eh? She's been trying to
clear herself by telling you some fairy-tale or another,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I repeat, Mrs. Petre," I said with anger, "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
have no desire nor intention to act towards Digby
in any way other than with friendliness."</p>

<p>"Ah! You expect me to believe that, my dear
sir," she laughed, snapping her fingers airily. "No,
that girl is his enemy, and I am hers."</p>

<p>"And that is the reason why you have sent the
anonymous letter to the police!" I said in a low,
hard voice, my eyes full upon her.</p>

<p>She started at my words.</p>

<p>"What letter?" she asked, in pretence of
ignorance.</p>

<p>"The one mentioned at the adjourned inquest
at Kensington," I replied. "The one in which you
offer to sell the life of the woman I love!"</p>

<p>"So you know she is guilty&mdash;eh?" the woman
asked. "She has confessed it to you&mdash;has she
not?"</p>

<p>"No. She is innocent," I cried. "I will never
believe in her guilt until it is proved."</p>

<p>"Then it will not be long, Mr. Royle, before you
will have quite sufficient proof," she replied with a
triumphant smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>"You are prepared to sell those proofs, I
understand," I said, suddenly assuming an air
of extreme gravity. "Now, I'm a business man.
If you wish to dispose of this information,
why not sell it to me?"</p>

<p>She laughed in my face.</p>

<p>"No, not to you, my dear sir. My business is
with the police, not with the girl's lover," was her
quick response.</p>

<p>"But the price," I said. "I will outbid the police
if necessary."</p>

<p>"No doubt you would be only too glad of the
chance of saving the girl who has so cleverly deceived
you. But, without offence, Mr. Royle, I certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
think you are a fool to act as you are now acting,"
she added. "A foul crime of jealousy has been
committed, and the assassin must pay the penalty
of her crime."</p>

<p>"And you allege jealousy as the motive?"
I gasped.</p>

<p>"Most certainly," she answered. Then, after a
pause of a few seconds, she added&mdash;"The girl you
have so foolishly trusted and in whom you still
believe so implicitly, left her home in Cromwell
Road in the night, as she had often done before,
and walked round to Harrington Gardens in order
to see Digby. There, in his rooms, she met her
rival&mdash;she had suspicions and went there on purpose
armed with a knife. And with it she struck the girl
down, and killed her."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" I cried, starting to my feet. "A
foul, wicked lie!"</p>

<p>"But what I say can be proved."</p>

<p>"At a price," I said bitterly.</p>

<p>"As you are a business man, so I am a business
woman, Mr. Royle," she replied quite calmly.
"When I see an opportunity of making money, I do
not hesitate to seize it."</p>

<p>"But if you know the truth&mdash;if this is the
actual truth which at present I will not believe&mdash;then
it is your duty, nay, you are bound by
law to go to the police and tell them what you
know."</p>

<p>"I shall do that, never fear," she laughed. "But
first I shall try and get something for my
trouble."</p>

<p>"And whom do you intend to bring up as witness
against Miss Shand?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Wait and see. There will be a witness&mdash;an
eye-witness, who was present, and whose evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
will be corroborated," she declared in due course
with a self-satisfied air. "I have not resolved
to reveal the truth without fully reviewing the
situation. When the police know&mdash;as they certainly
will&mdash;you will then find that I have not lied, and
perhaps you will alter your opinion of the girl you
now hold in such high esteem."</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>DISCLOSES THE TRAP.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> woman's words held me speechless.</p>

<p>She seemed so cold, so determined, so certain of
her facts that I felt, when I came to consider what
I already had proved, that she was actually telling
me the ghastly truth.</p>

<p>And yet I loved Phrida. No. I refused to allow
my suspicions to be increased by this woman who
had approached the police openly and asked for
payment for her information.</p>

<p>She was Phrida's enemy. Therefore it was my
duty to treat her as such, and in a moment I had
decided upon my course of action.</p>

<p>"So I am to take it that both Digby and yourself
are antagonistic towards Phrida Shand?" I exclaimed,
leaning against the round mahogany table
and facing her.</p>

<p>She did not speak for a few seconds, then,
springing to her feet, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Would you excuse me for a few seconds?
I forgot to give an order to my servant who is just
going out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>And she bustled from the room, leaving me alone
with my own confused thoughts.</p>

<p>Ah! The puzzling problem was maddening me.
In my investigations I now found myself in a
cul-de-sac from which there seemed no escape.
The net, cleverly woven without a doubt, was slowly
closing about my poor darling, now so pale,
and anxious, and trembling.</p>

<p>Had she not already threatened to take her own
life at first sign of suspicion being cast upon her by
the police!</p>

<p>Was that not in itself, alas! a sign that her secret
was a guilty one?</p>

<p>I knew not what to do, or how to act.</p>

<p>I suppose my hostess had been absent for about
five minutes when the door suddenly re-opened, and
she entered.</p>

<p>"When we were interrupted, Mrs. Petre," I said,
as she advanced towards me, "I was asking you a
plain question. Please give me a plain reply.
You and Phrida Shand are enemies, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Well, we are not exactly friends," she laughed,
"after all that has occurred. I think I told you
that in London."</p>

<p>"I remember all that you told me," I replied.
"But I want to know the true position, if&mdash;whether
we are friends, or enemies? For myself, it matters
not. I will be your friend with just as great a
satisfaction as I will be your enemy. Now, let us
understand each other. I have told you, I'm a
man of business."</p>

<p>The woman, clever and resourceful, smiled sweetly,
and in a calm voice replied:</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Royle, I don't see why, after all,
we should be enemies, that is, if what you tell me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
is the positive truth, that you owe my friend Digby
no ill-will."</p>

<p>"I owe no man ill-will until his perfidy is proved,"
was my reply. "I merely went to Brussels to try
and find him and request an explanation. He
charged me with a mission which I discharged
with the best of my ability, but which, it seems,
has only brought upon me a grave calamity&mdash;the
loss of the one I love. Hence I am entitled to some
explanation from his own lips!"</p>

<p>"Which I promise you that you shall have in
due course. So rest assured upon that point,"
she urged. "But that is in the future. We are,
however, discussing the present. By the way&mdash;you'll
take something to drink, won't you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," I protested.</p>

<p>"But you must have something. I'm sorry I
have no whisky to offer you, but I have some rather
decent port," and disregarding my repeated protests,
she rang the bell, whereupon the young man who
had admitted me&mdash;whom I now found to my surprise
to be a servant&mdash;entered and bowed.</p>

<p>"Bring some port," his mistress ordered, and a
few moments later he reappeared with a decanter
and glasses upon a silver tray.</p>

<p>She poured me out a glass, but refused to have
any herself.</p>

<p>"No, no," she laughed, "at my time of life port
wine would only make me fat&mdash;and Heaven knows
I'm growing horribly stout now. You don't know,
Mr. Royle, what horror we women have of stoutness.
In men it is a sign of ease and prosperity, in women
it is suggestive of alcoholism and puts ten years on
their ages."</p>

<p>Out of politeness, I raised my glass to her and
drank. Her demeanour had altered, and we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
now becoming friends, a fact which delighted me,
for I saw I might, by the exercise of a little judicious
diplomacy, act so as to secure protection for Phrida.</p>

<p>While we were chatting, I suddenly heard the
engine of my taxi started, and the clutch put in
with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Why!" I exclaimed, surprised. "I believe
that's my taxi going away. I hope the man isn't
tired of waiting!"</p>

<p>"No. I think it is my servant. I 'phoned for a
cab for her, as I want her to take a message into
Colchester," Mrs. Petre replied. Then, settling
herself in the big chair, she asked:</p>

<p>"Now, why can't we be friends, Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"That I am only too anxious to be," I declared.</p>

<p>"It is only your absurd infatuation for Phrida
Shand that prevents you," she said. "Ah!" she
sighed. "How grossly that girl has deceived you!"</p>

<p>I bit my lip. My suspicions were surely bitter
enough without the sore being re-opened by
this woman.</p>

<p>Had not Phrida's admissions been a self-condemnation
to which, even though loving her
as fervently as I did, I could not altogether
blind myself.</p>

<p>I did not speak. My heart was too full, and
strangely enough my head seemed swimming, but
certainly not on account of the wine I had drunk,
for I had not swallowed more than half the
glass contained.</p>

<p>The little room seemed to suddenly become
stifling. Yet that woman with the dark eyes
seemed to watch me intently as I sat there, watch
me with a strange, deep, evil glance&mdash;an expression
of fierce animosity which even at that moment she
could not conceal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>She had openly avowed that the hand of my
well-beloved had killed the unknown victim because
of jealousy. Well, when I considered all the facts
calmly and deliberately, her words certainly seemed
to bear the impress of truth.</p>

<p>Phrida had confessed to me that, rather than
face inquiry and condemnation she would take
her own life. Was not that in itself sufficient
evidence of guilt?</p>

<p>But no! I strove to put such thoughts behind
me. My brain was awhirl, nay, even aflame, for
gradually there crept over me a strange, uncanny
feeling of giddiness such as I had never before
experienced, a faint, sinking feeling, as though the
chair was giving way beneath me.</p>

<p>"I don't know why, but I'm feeling rather
unwell," I remarked to my hostess. Surely it could
not be due to my overwrought senses and my
strained anxiety for Phrida's safety.</p>

<p>"Oh! Perhaps it's the heat of the room," the
woman replied. "This place gets unpleasantly
warm at night. You'll be better in a minute or two,
no doubt. I'll run and get some smelling salts.
It is really terribly close in here," and, rising quickly,
she left me alone.</p>

<p>I remember that instantly she had disappeared
a red mist gathered before my eyes, and with a
fearful feeling of asphyxiation I struggled violently,
and fell back exhausted into my chair, while my
limbs grew suddenly icy cold, though my brow
was burning.</p>

<p>To what could it be due?</p>

<p>I recollect striving to think, to recall facts, to
reason within myself, but in vain. My thoughts
were so confused that grim, weird shadows and
grotesque forms arose within my imagination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Scenes, ludicrous and tragic, wildly fantastic and yet
horrible, were conjured up in my disordered brain,
and with them all, pains&mdash;excruciating pains, which
shot through from the sockets of my eyes to the back
of my skull, inflicting upon me tortures indescribable.</p>

<p>I set my teeth in determination not to lose consciousness
beneath the strain, and my eyes were
fixed upon the wall opposite. I remember now the
exact pattern of the wallpaper, a design of pale
blue trellis-work with crimson rambler roses.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have remained in that position,
sunk into a heap in the chair, for fully five
minutes, though to me it seemed hours when I
suddenly became conscious of the presence of persons
behind me.</p>

<p>I tried to move&mdash;to turn and look&mdash;but found that
every muscle in my body had become paralysed.
I could not lift a finger, neither would my lips
articulate any sound other than a gurgle when I
tried to cry out. And yet I remained in a state of
consciousness, half blotted out by those weird,
fantastic and dreamy shapes, due apparently to
the effect of that wine upon my brain.</p>

<p>Had I been deliberately poisoned? The startling
truth flashed across my mind just as I heard a low
stealthy movement behind me.</p>

<p>Yes. I was helpless there, in the hands of my
enemies. I, wary as I believed myself to be, had
fallen into a trap cunningly prepared by that clever
woman who was Digby's accomplice.</p>

<p>I now believed all that Edwards had told me
of the man's cunning and his imposture. How
that he had assumed the identity of a clever and
renowned man who had died so mysteriously in
South America. Perhaps he had killed him&mdash;who
could tell?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>As these bitter thoughts regarding the man whom
I had looked upon as a friend flitted through my
brain, I saw to my amazement, standing boldly
before me, the woman Petre with two men, one
a dark-bearded, beetle-browed, middle-aged man of
Hindu type&mdash;a half-caste probably&mdash;while the other
was the young man who had admitted me.</p>

<p>The Hindu bent until his scraggy whiskers almost
touched my cheek, looking straight into my eyes
with keen, intent gaze, but without speaking.</p>

<p>I saw that the young man had carried a small
deal box about eighteen inches square, which he
had placed upon the round mahogany table in the
centre of the room.</p>

<p>This table the woman pushed towards my chair
until I was seated before it. But she hardly gave
me a glance.</p>

<p>I tried to speak, to inquire the reason of such
strange proceedings, but it seemed that the drug
which had been given me in that wine had produced
entire muscular paralysis. I could not move,
neither could I speak. My brain was on fire and
swimming, yet I remained perfectly conscious,
horrified to find myself so utterly and entirely
helpless.</p>

<p>The sallow-faced man, in whose black eyes was an
evil, murderous look, and upon whose thin lips
there played a slight, but triumphant smile, took
both my arms and laid them straight upon the
table.</p>

<p>I tried with all my power to move them, but to
no purpose. As he placed them, so they remained.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, the woman spoke, and
addressing me, said in a hard, harsh tone:</p>

<p>"You are Digby's enemy, and mine, Mr. Royle.
Therefore you will now see the manner in which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
treat those who endeavour to thwart our ends.
You have been brave, but your valour has not
availed you much. The secret of Digby Kemsley
is still a secret&mdash;and will ever be a secret," she
added in a slow, meaning voice.</p>

<p>And as she uttered those words the half-bred
Indian took my head in his hands and forced my
body forward until my head rested upon the table
between my outstretched arms.</p>

<p>Again I tried to raise myself, and to utter protest,
but only a low gurgling escaped my parched lips.
My jaws were set and I could not move them.</p>

<p>Ah! the situation was the strangest in which
I have ever found myself in all my life.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while my head lay upon the polished
table I saw the Hindu put a short double-reed pipe
to his mouth, and next instant the room was filled
with weird, shrill music, while at the same moment
he unfastened the side of the little box and let down
the hinged flap.</p>

<p>Again the native music sounded more shrill
than before, while the woman and the young man-servant
had retreated backward towards the door,
their eyes fixed upon the mysterious box upon
the table.</p>

<p>I, too, had my eyes upon the box.</p>

<p>Suddenly I caught sight of something within, and
next second held my breath, realising the horrible
torture that was intended.</p>

<p>I lay there helpless, powerless to draw back
and save myself.</p>

<p>Again the sounds of the pipe rose and then died
away slowly in a long drawn-out wail.</p>

<p>My eyes were fixed upon that innocent-looking
little box in horror and fascination.</p>

<p>Ah! Something moved again within.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw it&mdash;saw it quite plainly.</p>

<p>I tried to cry out&mdash;to protest, to shout for help.
But in vain.</p>

<p>Surely this woman's vengeance was indeed a
fiendish and relentless one.</p>

<p>My face was not more than a foot away from the
mysterious box, and when I fully realised, in my
terror, what was intended, I think my brain must
have given way.</p>

<p>I became insane!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>THE SEAL OF SILENCE.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">Yes</span>, there was no doubt about it. Terror and
horror had driven me mad.</p>

<p>And surely the deadly peril in which I found
myself was in itself sufficient to cause the cheek of
the bravest man to pale, for from that box there
slowly issued forth a large, hideous cobra, which,
coiling with sinuous slowness in front of my face
held its hooded head erect, ready to strike.</p>

<p>While the Hindu played that weird music on the
pipes its head with the two beady eyes and flickering
tongue, moved slowly to and fro. It was watching
me and ready to deal its fatal blow.</p>

<p>The woman saw the perspiration standing upon
my white brow, and burst out laughing, still standing
at a safe distance near the door.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Royle, you won't have much further
opportunity of investigation," she exclaimed. "You
have become far too inquisitive, and you constitute
a danger&mdash;hence this action. I'm very sorry, but
it must be so," declared the brutal, inhuman woman.</p>

<p>She was watching, gloating over her triumph;
waiting, indeed, for my death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely I was not their first victim! All had been
carried out in a method which showed that the paralysing
drug and the deadly reptile had been used
before by this strange trio.</p>

<p>The music, now being played incessantly, apparently
prevented the snake from darting at me,
as it was, no doubt, under the hypnotic influence of
its master. But I knew that the moment the
music ceased it would be my last.</p>

<p>With frantic efforts I struggled to withdraw
my head and hands from the reptile's reach, but
every muscle seemed powerless. I could not
budge an inch.</p>

<p>Again I tried to speak, to shout for help, but no
word could I articulate. I was dead in all save
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," laughed Mrs. Petre hoarsely; "we're
just playing you a little music&mdash;to send you to
sleep&mdash;to put the seal of silence upon you, Mr.
Royle. And I hope you'll sleep very well to-night&mdash;very
well&mdash;as no doubt you will!" and she gave
vent to a loud peal of harsh laughter.</p>

<p>Then, for a moment she hesitated, until suddenly
she cried to the Hindu:</p>

<p>"Enough!"</p>

<p>The music ceased instantly, and the snake, whose
hooded head had been swaying to and fro slowly,
suddenly shot up erect.</p>

<p>The spell of the music was broken, and I knew
my doom was sealed.</p>

<p>Those small, brilliant eyes were fastened upon
mine, staring straight at me, the head moving very
slowly, while those three brutes actually watched
my agony of terror, and exchanged smiles as they
waited for the reptile to strike its fatal blow.</p>

<p>In an instant its fangs would, I knew, be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
my face, and into my blood would be injected
that deadly venom which must inevitably prove
fatal.</p>

<p>Yes, I had been entrapped, and they held the
honours in the game. After my death Phrida
would be denounced, accused, and convicted as an
assassin. Because, perhaps, I might be a witness in
her favour, or even assist her to escape arrest, this
woman had taken the drastic step of closing my
lips for ever.</p>

<p>But was it with Digby's knowledge? Had he
ever been her accomplice in similar deeds to this?</p>

<p>Suddenly I recollected with a start what Edwards
had told me&mdash;that the real Sir Digby Kemsley, an
invalid, had died of snake-bite in mysterious circumstances,
in Peru; and that his friend, a somewhat
shady Englishman named Cane, had been suspected
of placing the reptile near him, owing to the shouts
of terror of the doomed man being overheard by a
Peruvian man-servant.</p>

<p>Was it possible that the man whom I had known
as Digby was actually Cane?</p>

<p>The method of the snake was the same as that
practised at Huacho!</p>

<p>These, and other thoughts, flashed across my
brain in an instant, for I knew that the agony of a
fearful death would be quickly upon me.</p>

<p>I tried to utter a curse upon those three brutes
who stood looking on without raising a hand to save
me, but still I could not speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly, something black shot across my startled
eyes. The reptile had darted.</p>

<p>The horror of that moment held me transfixed.</p>

<p>I felt a sharp sting upon my left cheek, and next
instant, petrified by a terror indescribable, I lost
consciousness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>What happened afterwards I have no idea. I
can only surmise.</p>

<p>How long I remained senseless I cannot tell. All
I am aware of is that when I returned to a knowledge
of things about me I had a feeling that my
limbs were benumbed and cramped. Against my
head was a cold, slimy wall, and my body was lying
in water.</p>

<p>For a time, dazed as I was, I could not distinguish
my position. My thoughts were all confused; all
seemed pitch darkness, and the silence was complete
save for the slow trickling of water somewhere near
my head.</p>

<p>I must have lain there a full hour, slowly gathering
my senses. The back of my head was very sore,
for it seemed as though I had received a heavy
blow, while my elbows and knees seemed cut
and bruised.</p>

<p>In the close darkness I tried to discover where I
was, but my brain was swimming with an excruciating
pain in the top of my skull.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, recollections of the past came
back to me&mdash;remembrance of that terrible, final
half-hour.</p>

<p>Yes, Joy! I was still alive; the loathsome
reptile's fang had not produced death. It may
have bitten some object and evacuated its venom
just prior to biting me. That was the theory
which occurred to me, and I believe it to be the
correct one.</p>

<p>I could raise my hand, too. I was no longer
paralysed. I could speak. I shouted, but my
voice seemed deadened and stifled.</p>

<p>On feeling my head I found that I had a long
scalp-wound, upon which the blood was congealed.
My clothes were rent, and as I groped about I quickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
found that my prison was a circular wall of stone,
wet and slimy, about four feet across, and that I
was half reclining in water with soft, yielding mud
beneath me, while the air seemed close and foul.</p>

<p>The roof above me seemed high, for my voice
appeared to ascend very far. I looked above me
and high up, so high that I could only just distinguish
it was a tiny ray of light&mdash;the light of day.</p>

<p>With frantic fingers I felt those circular walls,
thick with the encrustations and slime of ages. Then
all of a sudden the truth flashed upon me. My
enemies, believing me dead, had thrown me down
a well!</p>

<p>I shouted and shouted, yelled again and again.
But my voice only echoed high up, and no one
came to my assistance.</p>

<p>My legs, immersed as they were in icy-cold water,
were cramped and benumbed, so that I had no
feeling in them, while my hands were wet and cold,
and my head hot as fire.</p>

<p>As far as I could judge in the darkness, the well
must have been fully eighty feet or so deep, and
after I had been flung headlong down it the wooden
trap-door had been re-closed. It was through the
chink between the two flaps that I could see the
blessed light of day.</p>

<p>I shouted again, yelling with all my might:
"Help! Help!" in the hope that somebody in
the vicinity might hear me and investigate.</p>

<p>I was struggling in order to shift into a more
comfortable position, and in doing so my feet sank
deeper into the mud at the bottom of the well&mdash;the
accumulation of many years, no doubt.</p>

<p>Two perils faced me&mdash;starvation, or the rising of
the water: for if it should rain above, the water
percolating through the earth would cause it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
rise in the well and overwhelm me. By the dampness
of the wall I could feel that it was not long
since the water was much higher than my head, as
I now stood upright.</p>

<p>Would assistance come?</p>

<p>My heart sank within me when I thought of the
possibility that I had been precipitated into the
well in the garden of Melbourne House, in which
case I could certainly not hope for succour.</p>

<p>Again I put out my hands, frantically groping
about me, when something I touched in the darkness
caused me to withdraw my hand with a start.</p>

<p>Cautiously I felt again. My eager fingers touched
it, for it seemed to be floating on the surface of
the water. It was cold, round, and long&mdash;the body
of a snake!</p>

<p>I drew my hand away. Its contact thrilled me.</p>

<p>The cobra had been killed and flung in after
me! In that case the precious trio had, without a
doubt, fled.</p>

<p>Realisation of the utter hopelessness of the situation
sent a cold shudder through me. I had miraculously
escaped death by the snake's fangs, and was
I now to die of starvation deep in that narrow
well?</p>

<p>Again and again I shouted with all my might,
straining my eyes to that narrow chink which
showed so far above. Would assistance never come?
I felt faint and hungry, while my wounds gave me
considerable pain, and my head throbbed so that
I felt it would burst at any moment.</p>

<p>I found a large stone in the mud, and with it
struck hard against the wall. But the sound was
not such as might attract the attention of anybody
who happened to be near the vicinity of the well.
Therefore I shouted and shouted again until my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
voice grew hoarse, and I was compelled to desist
on account of my exhaustion.</p>

<p>For fully another half-hour I was compelled to
remain in impatience and anxiety in order to recover
my voice and strength for, weak as I was, the exertion
had almost proved too much for me. So I stood
there with my back to the slimy wall, water reaching
beyond my knees, waiting and hoping against
hope.</p>

<p>At last I shouted again, as loudly as before, but,
alas! only the weird echo came back to me in the
silence of that deeply-sunk shaft. I felt stifled, but,
fortunately for me, the air was not foul.</p>

<p>Yes, my assassins had hidden me, together with
the repulsive instrument of their crime, in that disused
well, confident that no one would descend to
investigate and discover my remains. How many
persons, I wonder, are yearly thrown down wells
where the water is known to be impure, or where
the existence of the well itself is a secret to all but
the assassin?</p>

<p>I saw it all now. My taxi-man must have been
paid and dismissed by that thin-faced young man,
yet how cleverly the woman had evaded my question,
and how glib her explanation of her servant going
into the town in a taxi.</p>

<p>When she had risen from her chair and left me,
it was, no doubt, to swiftly arrange how my death
should be encompassed.</p>

<p>Surely that isolated, ivy-covered house was a
house of grim shadows&mdash;nay, a house of death&mdash;for
I certainly was not the first person who had been
foully done to death within its walls.</p>

<p>As I waited, trying to possess myself with patience,
and hoping against hope that I might still be rescued
from my living tomb, the little streak of light grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
brighter high above, as though the wintry sun was
shining.</p>

<p>I strained my ears to catch any sound beyond the
slow trickling of the water from the spring, but,
alas! could distinguish nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, I heard a dull report above,
followed quickly by a second, and then another in
the distance, and another. At first I listened much
puzzled; but next moment I realised the truth.</p>

<p>There was a shooting-party in the vicinity!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE TOMB.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">Again</span> I shouted&mdash;yelled aloud with all my might.
I placed my hands to my mouth, making a trumpet
of them, and shouted upwards:</p>

<p>"Help! For God's sake! Help! I'm down
here&mdash;dying! Help!&mdash;<i>Help!</i>"</p>

<p>A dozen times I yelled my appeal, but with the
same negative result. Whoever had fired in the
vicinity was either too far away, or too occupied
with his sport to hear me.</p>

<p>I heard another shot fired&mdash;more distant than
the rest. Then my heart sank within me&mdash;the party
were receding.</p>

<p>I don't know how long I waited&mdash;perhaps another
hour&mdash;when I thought I would try again. Therefore
I recommenced my shouts for assistance, yelling
frantically towards the high-up opening.</p>

<p>Suddenly the streak of light became obscured, and
dust and gravel fell upon me, the latter striking
my head with great force from such a height.</p>

<p>I heard a noise above&mdash;a footstep upon the wooden
flap of the well. My heart gave a bound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Help!" I yelled. "Open the well! I'm down
here&mdash;dying. Save me! Fetch assistance!"</p>

<p>The feet above moved, and a moment later I saw
above me a round disc of daylight and a head&mdash;a
girl's head&mdash;silhouetted within it.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" she asked in a timid, half-frightened
voice.</p>

<p>"It's me!" I cried. "Get me out of this! I'm
dying. Get me a rope or something, quickly!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the girl, still frightened
at her discovery.</p>

<p>"I'm a man who's been thrown down here, and I
can't get out. Get somebody to help me, I beg
of you!"</p>

<p>"All right!" she replied. "There's some men,
shooting here. I'll run and tell them."</p>

<p>And her face disappeared from the disc of daylight.</p>

<p>At last! Help was forthcoming, and I breathed
more freely.</p>

<p>I suppose about five minutes must have elapsed
before I saw above me the heads of two men in
golf-caps, peering over the edge of the well.</p>

<p>"Hulloa!" cried one in a refined voice, "what
are you doing down there?"</p>

<p>"Doing!" I echoed, "you should come down
and see!" I said with some sarcasm. "But, I
say! Send me down a rope, will you? I'm a
prisoner here."</p>

<p>"Have you been thrown in there?" asked the
voice. "This lady says you have."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. I'll tell you a strange story when
you get me out."</p>

<p>"All right!" exclaimed the other. "Hold on!
We'll go over to the farm and get a rope. Why, I
was here half-an-hour ago, and never dreamt you
were down there. Hold on!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>And the two faces disappeared, their places being
taken by the silhouette of the girl.</p>

<p>"I say!" I cried. "Where am I? What do they
call this place?"</p>

<p>"Well, this is one of the fields of Coppin's Farm,
just outside Lexden Park."</p>

<p>"Do you know Melbourne House?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Miss Morgan's. She's dead," replied
the girl's voice from above. "It's out on the high
road&mdash;close by."</p>

<p>"Is this well in the middle of a field, then?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"In the corner. Some old, half-ruined cottages
stood here till a couple of years ago, when they were
pulled down."</p>

<p>"And this was the well belonging to them?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she replied, and a few minutes
later I heard voices and saw several heads peering
down at me, while now and then gravel fell upon
my unprotected head, causing me to put my hands
up to protect it.</p>

<p>"I say!" cried the man's voice who had first
addressed me, "We're sending down a rope. Can
you fasten it round you, and then we'll haul you
up? I expect you're in a pretty state, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm not very presentable, I fear," I
laughed.</p>

<p>Then down came a stout farmer's rope, several
lengths of which were knotted together after some
delay, until its end dangled before me.</p>

<p>"I hope you've joined it all right," I cried. "I
don't want to drop down!"</p>

<p>"No, it's all right!" one of the men&mdash;evidently
a labourer&mdash;declared. "You needn't fear, mister."</p>

<p>I made a knot in the end, then, placing it around
both my thighs, made a slip knot and clung to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
rope above. This took me some minutes. Then,
when all was ready, I gave the signal to haul.</p>

<p>"Slowly!" I shouted, for I was swinging from
side to side of the well, bruising my elbows and
knees. "Haul slower! I'm getting smashed to
pieces!"</p>

<p>They heeded me, and with care I was gradually
drawn up to the blessed light of day&mdash;a light which,
for a few minutes, nearly blinded me, so exhausted
and dazed was I.</p>

<p>Naturally I was beset by a hundred queries as to
how I came to be imprisoned in such a place.</p>

<p>But I sat down upon the ground, a strange,
begrimed and muddy figure, no doubt, gazing about
me for a few moments unable to speak.</p>

<p>I was in the corner of a bare, brown field, with a
high hedgerow close by. Around were the foundations
of demolished cottages, and I was seated upon
a heap of brick-rubbish and plaster.</p>

<p>The two who were dressed in rough, shooting kit
I took to be military men, while three others were
farm-hands, and the girl&mdash;a tall, rather good-looking
open-air girl, was dressed in a short, tweed skirt,
well-cut, a thick jacket, a soft felt hat, and heavy,
serviceable boots. No second glance was needed
to show that, although so roughly dressed, she was
undoubtedly a lady.</p>

<p>One of the men called her Maisie, and later I knew
that her name was Maisie Morrice, that she was his
sister, who had been walking with the "guns."</p>

<p>My presence down the well certainly needed
explanation, and as they had rescued me, it was
necessary to satisfy their natural curiosity.</p>

<p>"I had a curious adventure here last night," I
told them, after pausing to take breath. "I came
from London to see a lady living at Melbourne House.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
A lady named Petre&mdash;but I was given some drugged
wine, and&mdash;well, when I came to I found myself
down there. That's all."</p>

<p>"A very unpleasant experience, I should say,"
remarked the elder of the two sportsmen, a tall,
grey-moustached man, as he surveyed me. "I
suppose you'll go back to Melbourne House and get
even with the lady? I would!"</p>

<p>"Melbourne House!" echoed the other man.
"Why, Maisie, that's where old Miss Morgan lived,
and it's been taken by some woman with an Indian
servant, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl. "She's been there a
month or two, but quite a mystery. Nobody has
called on her. Mother wouldn't let me."</p>

<p>"Apparently she's not a very desirable acquaintance,"
remarked her brother grimly.</p>

<p>"I want to go there," I said feebly, trying
to rise.</p>

<p>"You seem to have hurt your head pretty badly,"
remarked the elder sportsman. "I suppose you'd
better go into Colchester and see the police&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I'll drive him in, sir," volunteered one of the
men, whom I took to be the farmer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Cuppin," exclaimed the girl. "Get
your trap and drive this gentleman to the doctor
and the police."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I replied. "But I don't want the
people at Melbourne House to know that I'm alive.
They believe me dead, and it will be a pretty surprise
for them when I return, after seeing the doctor. So
I ask you all to remain silent about this affair&mdash;at
least for an hour or so. Will you?"</p>

<p>They all agreed to do so, and, being supported
by two of the men, I made my way across the field<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
to the farm; and ten minutes later was driving
into Colchester in the farmer's dog-cart.</p>

<p>At the "Cups" my appearance caused some sensation,
but, ascending to my room, I quickly washed,
changed my ruined suit, and made myself presentable,
and then went to see an elderly and rather
fussy doctor, who put on his most serious professional
air, and who was probably the most renowned
medical man in the town. The provincial medico,
when he becomes a consultant, nearly always
becomes pompous and egotistical, and in his own
estimation is the only reliable man out of Harley
Street.</p>

<p>The man I visited was one of the usual type, a
man of civic honours, with the aspirations of a
mayoralty, I surmised. I think he believed that
I had injured my head while in a state of intoxication,
so I did not undeceive him, and allowed his assistant
to bathe and bandage my wound and also the bite
upon my cheek, while the farmer waited outside
for me.</p>

<p>When at last I emerged, I hesitated.</p>

<p>Should I go to the police and tell them what had
occurred? Or should I return alone to Melbourne
House, and by my presence thwart whatever sinister
plans might be in progress.</p>

<p>If I went to the police I would be forced to explain
much that I desired, at least for the present, to
keep secret. And, after all, the local police could
not render me much assistance. I might give the
woman and her accomplices in charge for attempted
murder, but would such course help in the solution
of the Harrington Gardens affair?</p>

<p>After a few moments' reflection I decided to drive
straight to the house of shadows and demand an
explanation of the dastardly attempt upon me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Mr. Cuppin pulled up
near the long, ivy-covered house, and, alighting, I
made my way within the iron gate and up the
gravelled path to the front door, where I rang.</p>

<p>I listened attentively, and heard someone moving.</p>

<p>Yes, the house was not empty, as I had
half feared.</p>

<p>A moment later a neat maid-servant opened the
door, and regarded me with some surprise.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Petre at home?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No, sir, she isn't," replied the girl with a strong
East Anglian accent.</p>

<p>"When will she be in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I really don't know, sir," she said. "She hasn't
left word where she's gone."</p>

<p>"Is anyone else at home?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"How long have you been with Mrs. Petre?" I
asked, adding, in an apologetic tone, "I hope I'm
not too inquisitive?"</p>

<p>"I've been here about two months&mdash;ever since
she took the house."</p>

<p>"Don't you think your mistress a rather curious
person?" I asked, slipping half-a-sovereign into
her hand. She regarded the coin, and then
looked at me with a smile of surprise and satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hardly know what you mean, sir," she
faltered.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be quite frank with you," I said. "I'm
anxious to know something about what company
she keeps here. Last night, for instance, a gentleman
called in a taxi. Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," she answered. "Mistress sent me out
on an errand to the other side of the town, and when
I came back just before half-past eleven I found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the front door ajar, and everybody gone. And
nobody's been back here since."</p>

<p>After disposing of my body, then, the precious
trio had fled.</p>

<p>I knew that Phrida must now be in hourly peril
of arrest&mdash;for that woman would, now that she believed
me dead, lose not an instant in making a
damning statement to the police regarding what
had occurred on that night in Harrington Gardens.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>RECORDS A STRANGE STATEMENT.</h3>


<p class="gap2">"<span class="smcap">Will</span> you permit me to come inside a moment?"
I asked the girl. "I want you to tell me one or
two things, if you will."</p>

<p>At first she hesitated, but having surveyed me
critically and finding, I suppose, that I was not a
tramp she opened the door wider and admitted me
to the room wherein her mistress had entertained
me on the previous night.</p>

<p>I glanced quickly around. Yes, nothing had been
altered. There was the chair in which I had sat,
and the round, mahogany table upon which my head
had laid so helplessly while the reptile, charmed by
the Hindu's music, had sat erect with swaying head.</p>

<p>Ah! as that terrible scene again arose before
my eyes I stood horrified. The girl noticed my
demeanour, and looked askance at me.</p>

<p>"Does your mistress have many visitors?" I
asked her. "To tell you the truth, I'm making
these confidential inquiries on behalf of an insurance
company in London. So you can be perfectly open
with me. Mrs. Petre will never know that you
have spoken."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied the dark-eyed maid, after
a pause, during which time she twisted her dainty
little apron in her hand, "I suppose I really ought
not to say anything, but the fact is mistress acts
very curiously sometimes. Besides, I don't like Ali."</p>

<p>"You mean the Indian?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's too crafty and cunning," she replied.
"Sometimes in the middle of the night I wake up
and hear Ali, shut up in his room, playing on his
flute&mdash;such horrible music. And on such occasions
the mistress and Horton, the man, are usually with
him&mdash;listening to his concert, I suppose."</p>

<p>"On those occasions, have there been guests in
the house?" I asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Once, I think about a fortnight ago, a gentleman
had called earlier in the evening. But I did not
see him."</p>

<p>"Did you see him next morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he did not stay the night."</p>

<p>"But on this particular occasion, how did you
know that Mrs. Petre and Horton were in the
room with him?"</p>

<p>"Because I listened from the top of the stairs,
and could hear voices. The gentleman was in
there too, I believe, listening to the noise of
Ali's pipes."</p>

<p>Had the stranger fallen a victim to the serpent,
I wondered?</p>

<p>Who could he have been, and what was his fate?</p>

<p>"Has your mistress and her two servants left
you suddenly like this before?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Never, sir. I can't make it out. They seem
to have gone out with the gentleman who called&mdash;and
evidently they left all of a hurry."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because when I got back I found that my mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
had pulled out the first coat and hat she could find,
and had not taken even a handbag. Besides, if
she knew she was to be absent she would have left
me a note." And she added in a tone of resentment: "It
isn't fair to leave me by myself in a
lonely house like this!"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," I agreed. "But, tell me, does
your mistress have many callers?"</p>

<p>"Very few. She has had a visitor lately&mdash;a
gentleman. He stayed a few days, and then left
suddenly."</p>

<p>"Young or old?"</p>

<p>"Elderly, clean-shaven, and grey hair. She used
to call him Digby."</p>

<p>"Digby!" I echoed. "When was he here? Tell
me quickly!"</p>

<p>"Oh, about four days ago, I think. Yes&mdash;he
went away last Sunday night."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about him," I urged her. "He's a
friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, then perhaps I ought not to say anything,"
said the girl a little confused.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, you will be doing me the very
greatest service if you tell me all that you know
concerning him," I declared. "Don't think that
anything you say will annoy me, for it won't. He
was my friend, but he served me a very evil trick."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she replied, "he arrived here very
late one night, and my mistress sat with him in the
drawing-room nearly all night talking to him. I
crept down to try and hear what was going on, but
they were speaking so low, almost whispering, so
that I could catch only a few words."</p>

<p>"What did you hear?" I inquired breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Well, from what I could gather the gentleman
was in some grave danger&mdash;something to do with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a girl. Mistress seemed very excited and talked
about another girl, which she called Freda, or something
like that, and then the gentleman mentioned
somebody named Royle, whereon mistress seemed
to fly into a passion. I heard her say distinctly,
'You are a fool, Digby! If you're not very careful
you'll give the game away.' Then he said, 'If the
truth comes out, she will suffer, not me.'"</p>

<p>"Whom did you infer he meant by she?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, that's impossible to say," was her
response. "Well, they were alone there for hours.
He seemed to be begging her to tell him something,
but she steadily refused. And every time he
mentioned the name of Royle she became angry
and excited. Once I heard her say, 'As long as
you keep carefully out of the way, you need not
fear anything. Nobody&mdash;not even the girl&mdash;suspects
the truth. So I don't see that you need have the
slightest apprehension. But mind, you're going to
play the straight game with me, Digby, or, by
heaven! it will be the worse for you!'"</p>

<p>"Then she threatened him?" I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes. She seemed very determined and spoke
in a low, hard voice. Of course, I could only catch
a few disjointed words, and out of them I tried
to make sense. But I overheard sufficient to
know that the visitor was in a state of great agitation
and fear."</p>

<p>"Did he go out much?"</p>

<p>"All the time he was here I never knew him to
go further than the garden," said the maid, who
seemed to be unusually intelligent.</p>

<p>"What about Ali?"</p>

<p>"Ali was his constant companion. When they
were together they spoke in some foreign language."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>A sudden thought flashed across my mind.</p>

<p>Could Ali be a Peruvian Indian and not a Hindu?
Was he the accomplice of the mysterious Englishman
named Cane&mdash;the man suspected of causing the
death of Sir Digby Kemsley?</p>

<p>What this girl was revealing was certainly
amazing.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure that this man she called
Digby left the neighbourhood last Sunday?" I
asked her.</p>

<p>"Quite. I overheard him speaking with the
mistress late on Saturday night. He said, 'By this
time to-morrow I shall be back in Brussels.' And I
know he went there, for next day I posted a letter
to Brussels."</p>

<p>"To him?" I cried. "What was the address?"</p>

<p>"The name was Bryant, and it was addressed
Poste Restante, Brussels. I remember it, because
I carefully made a note of it, as the whole affair
seemed so extraordinary."</p>

<p>"But this man she called Digby. Was he well-dressed?"
I inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;not at all. He seemed poor and
shabby. He only had with him a little handbag,
but I believe he came from a considerable distance,
probably from abroad, expressly to see her."</p>

<p>"Then you think he is in Brussels now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I posted the letter on Monday night.
To-day is Wednesday," she said.</p>

<p>I reflected. My first impulse was to go straight
to Brussels and send a message to Mr. Bryant at
the Poste Restante&mdash;a message that would trap him
into an appointment with me.</p>

<p>But in face of Phrida's present peril could I
possibly leave London?</p>

<p>I was at the parting of the ways. To hesitate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
might be to lose trace of the man who had proved
such a false friend, while, by crossing to Brussels
again, I would be leaving Phrida to her fate.</p>

<p>"You heard no other mention of the person named
Royle?" I asked her after a brief pause, during
which I placed a second half-sovereign in her
hand.</p>

<p>She reflected for a moment, her eyes cast down
upon the carpet, as we stood together in that
sombre little room of horrors.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," she replied thoughtfully. "One
afternoon when I was taking tea into the drawing-room
where they were sitting together I heard
mistress say, 'I don't like that man Royle at all.
He means mischief&mdash;more especially as he loves
the girl.' The gentleman only laughed and said,
'Have no fear on that score. He knows nothing,
and is not likely to know, unless you tell him.'
Then mistress said, 'I've been a fool, perhaps, but
when we met I told him one or two things&mdash;sufficient
to cause him to think.' Then the gentleman stood
up angrily and cried out in quite a loud voice:
'What! you fool! You've actually told him&mdash;you've
allowed your infernal tongue to wag and let out the
truth!' But she said that she had not told all the
truth, and started abusing him&mdash;so much so that
he left the room and went out into the garden,
where, a few minutes later, I saw him talking
excitedly to Ali. But when the two men talked
I could, of course, understand nothing," added
the girl.</p>

<p>"Then your mistress declared that she didn't like
the man Royle, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she seemed to fear him&mdash;fear that he knew
too much about some business or other," replied
the maid. "And to tell you quite frankly, sir, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
watching the mistress and her visitor very
narrowly for a couple of days I came to the conclusion
that the gentleman was hiding&mdash;that perhaps
the police were after him."</p>

<p>"Why?" I inquired in a casual tone. "What
made you think that?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know. Perhaps from the scraps of
conversation I overheard, perhaps from his cunning,
secret manner&mdash;not but what he was always nice
to me, and gave me something when he left."</p>

<p>"You didn't hear any other names of persons
mentioned?" I asked. "Try and think, as all that
you tell me is of the greatest importance to me."</p>

<p>The girl stood silent, while I paced up and down
that room in which, not many hours before, I had
endured that awful mental torture. She drew her
hand across her brow, trying to recall.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was another name," she admitted at
last, "but I can't at the moment recall it."</p>

<p>"Ah, do!" I implored her. "Try and recall it.
I am in no hurry to leave."</p>

<p>Again the dark-eyed maid in the dainty apron
was silent&mdash;both hands upon her brow, as she had
turned from me and was striving to remember.</p>

<p>"It was some foreign name&mdash;a woman's name,"
she said.</p>

<p>I recollected the dead girl was believed to have
been a foreigner!</p>

<p>Suddenly she cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, I remember! The name was Mary Brack."</p>

<p>"Mary Brack!" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course I don't know how it's spelt."</p>

<p>"Well, if it were a foreign name it would probably
be Marie B-r-a-c-q&mdash;if you are sure you've pronounced
it right."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I'm quite sure. Mistress called her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
'poor girl!' so I can only suppose that something
must have happened to her."</p>

<p>I held my breath at her words.</p>

<p>Yes, without a doubt I had secured a clue to the
identity of the girl who lost her life at Harrington
Gardens.</p>

<p>Her name, in all probability, was Marie Bracq!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>"MARIE BRACQ!"</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">Marie Bracq!</span> The name rang in my ears in the
express all the way from Colchester to Liverpool
Street.</p>

<p>Just before six o'clock I alighted from a taxi in
Scotland Yard, and, ascending in the lift, soon found
myself sitting with Inspector Edwards.</p>

<p>At that moment I deemed it judicious to tell him
nothing regarding my night adventure in the
country, except to say:</p>

<p>"Well, I've had a strange experience&mdash;the
strangest any man could have, because I have dared
to investigate on my own account the mystery of
Harrington Gardens."</p>

<p>"Oh! tell me about it, Mr. Royle," he urged,
leaning back in his chair before the littered writing-table.</p>

<p>"There's nothing much to tell," was my reply.
"I'll describe it all some day. At present there's no
time to waste. I believe I am correct in saying
that the name of the murdered girl is Marie Bracq."</p>

<p>Edwards looked me straight in the face. "That's
not an English name, is it?" he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Belgian, I should say."</p>

<p>"Belgian? Yes, most probably," he said. "A
rather uncommon name, and one which ought
not to be difficult to trace. How did you find
this out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a long story, Mr. Edwards," I said.
"But I honestly believe that at last we are on the
scent. Cannot you discover whether any girl of
that name is missing?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I'll wire to the Brussels police at
once. Perhaps it will be well to ask the Pr&eacute;fect of
Police in Paris if they have any person of that
name reported missing," he said, and, ringing a bell,
a clerk appeared almost instantly with a writing-pad
and pencil.</p>

<p>"Wire to Brussels and Paris and ask if they have
any person named Marie Bracq&mdash;be careful of the
spelling&mdash;missing. If so, we will send them over
a photo."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the man replied, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Well," I asked casually, when we were alone,
"have you traced the tailor who made the dead
girl's costume?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. The Italian police are making every
inquiry."</p>

<p>"And what have you decided regarding that
letter offering to give information?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," was his prompt reply. "And if
this information you have obtained as to the
identity of the deceased proves correct, we shall
do nothing. It will be far more satisfactory to
work out the problem for ourselves, rather than
risk being misled by somebody who has an axe
to grind."</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm pleased that you view the matter in
that light," I said, much relieved. "I feel con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>fident
that I have gained the true name of
the victim."</p>

<p>"But how did you manage it, Mr. Royle?" he
asked, much interested.</p>

<p>I, however, refused to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p>"You certainly seem to know more about the
affair than we do," he remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, was I not a friend of the man who is now
a fugitive?" I remarked.</p>

<p>"Ah, of course! And depend upon it, Mr. Royle,
when this affair is cleared up, we shall find that
your friend was a man of very curious character,"
he said, pursing his lips. "Inquiries have shown
that many mysteries concerning him remain to
be explained."</p>

<p>For a moment I did not speak. Then I asked:</p>

<p>"Is anything known concerning a woman friend
of his named Petre?"</p>

<p>"Petre?" he echoed. "No, not that I'm aware
of. But it seemed that he was essentially what
might be called a ladies' man."</p>

<p>"I know that. He used to delight in entertaining
his lady friends."</p>

<p>"But who is this woman Petre whom you've
mentioned?" he inquired with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"The woman who is ready to give you information
for a consideration," I replied.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am acquainted with her. I was with
her last night," was my quick response. "Her
intention is to condemn a perfectly innocent
woman."</p>

<p>"Whom?" he asked sharply. "The woman who
lost that green horn comb at the flat?"</p>

<p>I held my breath.</p>

<p>"No, Edwards," I answered, "That question is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
unfair. As a gentleman, I cannot mention a lady's
name. If she chooses to do so that's another
matter. But if she does&mdash;as from motives of
jealousy she easily may do&mdash;please do not take any
action without first consulting me. Ere long I shall
have a strange, almost incredible, story to put
before you."</p>

<p>"Why not now?" he asked, instantly interested.</p>

<p>"Because I have not yet substantiated all my
facts," was my reply.</p>

<p>"Cannot I assist you? Why keep me in the
dark?" he protested.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you can render me no other assistance
except to hesitate to accept the allegations of that
woman Petre," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, we shall wait until she approaches us
again," he said.</p>

<p>"This I feel certain she will do," I exclaimed.
"But if you see her, make no mention whatever
of me&mdash;you understand? She believes me to be
dead, and therefore not likely to disprove her
allegations."</p>

<p>"Dead!" he echoed. "Really, Mr. Royle, all
this sounds most interesting."</p>

<p>"It is," I declared. "I believe I am now upon
the verge of a very remarkable discovery&mdash;that ere
long we shall know the details of that crime in
South Kensington."</p>

<p>"Well, if you do succeed in elucidating the mystery
you will accomplish a marvellous feat," said the
great detective, placing his hands together and
looking at me across his table. "I confess that
I'm completely baffled. That friend of yours who
called himself Kemsley has disappeared as completely
as though the ground had opened and
swallowed him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, Edwards, London's a big place," I laughed,
"and your men are really not very astute."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the man you want called at my
rooms in Albemarle Street only a few days
ago."</p>

<p>"What?" he cried, staring at me surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was unfortunately out, but he left a
message with my man that he would let me know
his address later."</p>

<p>"Amazing impudence!" cried my friend. "He
called in order to show his utter defiance of the
police, I should think."</p>

<p>"No. My belief is that he wished to tell me
something," I said. "Anyhow, he will either
return or send his address."</p>

<p>"I very much doubt it. He's a clever
rogue, but, like all men of his elusiveness and
cunning, he never takes undue chances. No,
Mr. Royle, depend upon it, he'll never visit
you again."</p>

<p>"But I may be able to find him. Who knows?"</p>

<p>The detective moved his papers aside, and with
a sigh admitted:</p>

<p>"Yes, you may have luck, to be sure."</p>

<p>Then, after some further conversation, he looked
at the piece of sticking plaster on my head and
remarked:</p>

<p>"I see you've had a knock. How did you
manage it?"</p>

<p>I made an excuse that in bending before my own
fireplace I had struck it on the corner of the mantelshelf.
Afterwards I suddenly said:</p>

<p>"You recollect those facts you told me regarding
the alleged death of the real Kemsley in Peru,
don't you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, they've interested me deeply. I'd so
much like to know any further details."</p>

<p>Edwards reflected a moment, recalling the report.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, taking from one of the
drawers in his table a voluminous official file of
papers. "There really isn't very much more than
what you already know. The Consul's report is
a very full one, and contains a quantity of
depositions taken on the spot&mdash;mostly evidence
of Peruvians, in which little credence can, perhaps,
be placed. Of course," he added, "the suspected
man Cane seems to have been a very bad lot.
He was at one time manager of a rubber
plantation belonging to a Portuguese company,
and some very queer stories were current regarding
him."</p>

<p>"What kind of stories?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, his outrageous cruelty to the natives when
they did not collect sufficient rubber. He used,
they said, to burn the native villages and massacre
the inhabitants without the slightest compunction.
He was known by the natives as 'The Red Englishman.'
They were terrified by him. His name,
it seems, was Herbert Cane, and so bad became
his reputation that he was dismissed by the company
after an inquiry by a commission sent from
Lisbon, and drifted into Argentina, sinking lower
and lower in the social scale."</p>

<p>Then, after referring to several closely-written
pages of foolscap, each one bearing the blue embossed
stamp of the British Consulate in Lima, he went
on:</p>

<p>"Inquiries showed that for a few months the
man Cane was in Monte Video, endeavouring to
obtain a railway concession for a German group of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
financiers, but his reputation became noised abroad
and he found it better to leave that city. Afterwards
he seems to have met Sir Digby and to have
become his bosom friend."</p>

<p>"And what were the exact circumstances of
Sir Digby's death?" I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Ah! they are veiled in mystery," was the
detective's response, turning again to the official
report and depositions of witnesses. "As I think I
told you, Sir Digby had met with an accident and
injured his spine. Cane, whose acquaintance he
made, brought him down to Lima, and a couple of
months later, under the doctor's advice, removed
him to a bungalow at Huacho. Here they lived
with a couple of Peruvian men-servants, named
Senos and Luis. Cane seemed devoted to his
friend, leading the life of a quiet, studious, refined
man&mdash;very different to his wild life on the
rubber plantation. One morning, however, on
a servant entering Sir Digby's room, he found
him dead, and an examination showed that he
had been bitten in the arm by a poisonous
snake. There were signs of a struggle, showing
the poor fellow's agony before he died. Cane,
entering shortly afterwards, was distracted with
grief, and telegraphed himself to the British
Consul at Lima. And, according to custom in
that country, that same evening the unfortunate
man was buried."</p>

<p>"Without any inquiry?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. At the time, remember, there was no
suspicion. A good many people die annually in
Peru of snake-bite," Edwards replied, again referring
to the file of papers before him. "It seems,
however, that three days later, the second Peruvian
servant&mdash;a man known as Senos&mdash;declared that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
during the night of the tragic affair he had heard
his master suddenly yell with terror and cry out
'You blackguard, Cane, you hell-fiend; take
the thing away. Ah! God! You&mdash;why, you've
killed me!'"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "But was this told to Cane?"</p>

<p>"Cane saw the man and strenuously denied
his allegation. He, indeed, went to the local Commissary
of Police and lodged a complaint against
the man Senos for falsely accusing him, saying
that he had done so out of spite, because a few
days before he had had occasion to reprimand him
for inattention to his duties. Further, Cane brought
up a man living five miles from Huacho who swore
that the accused man was at his bungalow on that
night, arriving at nine o'clock. He drank so
heavily that he could not get home, so he remained
there the night, returning at eight o'clock next
morning."</p>

<p>"And the police officials believed him&mdash;eh?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. But next day he left Huacho, expressing
a determination to go to Lima and make a
statement to the Consul there. But he never
arrived at the capital, and he has never been
seen since."</p>

<p>"Then a grave suspicion rests upon him?" I
remarked, reflecting upon my startling adventure
of the previous night.</p>

<p>"Certainly. But the curious thing is that no
attempt seems to have been made by the police
authorities in Lima to trace the man. They allowed
him to disappear, and took no notice of the
affair, even when the British Consul reported it. I
fancy police methods must be very lax ones
there," he added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what could have been the method of the
assassin?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, simply to allow the snake to strike at
the sleeping man, I presume," said the detective.
"Yet, one would have thought that after the snake
had bitten him he would have cried out for help.
But he did not."</p>

<p>Had the victim, I wondered, swallowed that
same tasteless drug that I had swallowed, and been
paralysed, as I had been?</p>

<p>"And the motive of the crime?" I asked.</p>

<p>Edwards shrugged his shoulders, and raised
his brows.</p>

<p>"Robbery, I should say," was his reply. "But,
strangely enough, there is no suggestion of theft
in this report; neither does there seem to be any
woman in the case."</p>

<p>"You, of course, suspect that my friend
Digby and the man Cane, are one and the same
person!" I said. "But is it feasible that if
Cane were really responsible for the death of
the real Sir Digby, would he have the bold
audacity to return to London and actually pose
as his victim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Royle," replied the detective, "I
think it most feasible. Great criminals have the
most remarkable audacity. Some really astounding
cases of most impudent impersonation have come
under my own observation during my career in
this office."</p>

<p>"Then you adhere to the theory which you
formed at first?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly," he replied; "and while it
seems that you have a surprise to spring upon me
very shortly, so have I one to spring upon you&mdash;one
which I fear, Mr. Royle," he added very slowly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
looking me gravely in the face&mdash;"I fear may come
as a great shock to you."</p>

<p>I sat staring at him, unable to utter a syllable.</p>

<p>He was alluding to Phrida, and to the damning
evidence against her.</p>

<p>What could he know? Ah! who had betrayed
my love?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>LOVE'S CONFESSION.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">I dined</span> alone at the Club, and afterwards sat over
my coffee in one of the smaller white-panelled rooms,
gazing up at the Adams ceiling, and my mind full
of the gravest thoughts.</p>

<p>What had Edwards meant when he promised
me an unpleasant surprise? Had the woman
Petre already made a statement incriminating my
well-beloved?</p>

<p>If so, I would at once demand the arrest of her
and her accomplices for attempted murder. It
had suggested itself to me to make a complete
revelation to Edwards of the whole of my exciting
adventure at Colchester, but on mature consideration
I saw that such a course might thwart my
endeavours to come face to face with Digby.</p>

<p>Therefore I had held my tongue.</p>

<p>But were Edwards' suspicions that the assassin
Cane and the man I knew as Sir Digby Kemsley
were one and the same, correct, or were they not?</p>

<p>The method by which the unfortunate Englishman
in Peru had been foully done to death was
similar to the means employed against myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
at Colchester on the previous night. Again, the
fact that the victim did not shout and call for
aid was, no doubt, due to the administration
of that drug which produced complete paralysis
of the muscles, and yet left the senses perfectly
normal.</p>

<p>Was that Indian whom they called Ali really a
Peruvian native&mdash;the accomplice of Cane? I now
felt confident that this was so.</p>

<p>But in what manner could the impostor have
obtained power over Phrida? Why did she not
take courage and reveal to me the truth?</p>

<p>Presently, I took a taxi down to Cromwell Road
and found my well-beloved, with thin, pale, drawn
face, endeavouring to do some fancy needlework
by the drawing-room fire. Her mother had retired
with a bad headache, she said, and she was alone.</p>

<p>"I expected you yesterday, Teddy," she said,
taking my hand. "I waited all day, but you
never came."</p>

<p>"I had to go into the country," I replied
somewhat lamely.</p>

<p>Then after a brief conversation upon trivialities,
during which time I sat regarding her closely, and
noting how nervous and agitated she seemed, she
suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"Well! Have you heard anything more of that
woman, Mrs. Petre?"</p>

<p>"I believe she's gone abroad," I replied,
with evasion.</p>

<p>Phrida's lips twitched convulsively, and she gave
vent to a slight sigh, of relief, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Tell me, dearest," I said, bending and stroking
her soft hair from her white brow. "Are you still
so full of anxiety? Do you still fear the exposure
of the truth?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not reply, but of a sudden buried her face
upon my shoulder and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I sighed, still stroking her hair sympathetically,
"I know what you must suffer,
darling&mdash;of the terrible mental strain upon you.
I believe in your innocence&mdash;I still believe in it,
and if you will bear a stout heart and trust
me, I believe I shall succeed in worsting your
enemies."</p>

<p>In a moment her tear-stained face was raised
to mine.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that you can, dear?"
she asked anxiously. "Do you actually anticipate
extricating me from this terrible position of doubt,
uncertainty, and guilt?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;if you will only trust me, and keep a brave
heart, darling," I said. "Already I have made
several discoveries&mdash;startling ones."</p>

<p>"About Mrs. Petre, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"About her and about others."</p>

<p>"What about her?"</p>

<p>"I have found out where she is living&mdash;down at
Colchester."</p>

<p>"What?" she gasped, starting. "You've been
down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there yesterday, and I saw Ali and
the two servants."</p>

<p>"You saw them&mdash;and spoke to them?" she
cried incredibly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But, Teddy&mdash;ah! You don't know how injudicious
it was for you to visit them. Why, you
might have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Might have what?" I asked, endeavouring to
betray no surprise at her words.</p>

<p>"Well, I mean you should not have ventured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
into the enemy's camp like that. It was dangerous,"
she declared.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"They are quite unscrupulous," she replied
briefly.</p>

<p>"They are your enemies, I know. But I cannot
see why they should be mine," I remarked.</p>

<p>"My enemies&mdash;yes!" my love cried bitterly.
"It will not be long before that woman makes a
charge against me, Teddy&mdash;one which I shall not
be able to refute."</p>

<p>"But I will assist you against them. I love
you, Phrida, and it is my duty to defend you,"
I declared.</p>

<p>"Ah! You were always so good and generous,"
she remarked wistfully. "But in this case I cannot,
alas, see how you can render me any aid! The
police will make inquiries, and&mdash;and then the end,"
she added in a voice scarce above a whisper.</p>

<p>"No, no!" I urged. "Don't speak in that
hopeless strain, darling. I know your position is a
terrible one. We need not refer to details; as they
are painful to both of us. But I am straining every
nerve&mdash;working night and day to clear up the
mystery and lift from you this cloud of suspicion.
I have already commenced by learning one or two
facts&mdash;facts of which the police remain in ignorance.
Although you refused to tell me&mdash;why, I cannot
discern&mdash;the name of the unfortunate girl who lost
her life, I have succeeded in gaining knowledge of it.
Was not the girl named Marie Bracq?"</p>

<p>She started again at hearing the name.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied at once. "Who told you?"</p>

<p>"I discovered it for myself," I replied. "Who
was the girl&mdash;tell me?"</p>

<p>"A friend of Digby Kemsley's."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"A foreigner, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Belgian, I believe."</p>

<p>"From Brussels, eh?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I don't know for certain."</p>

<p>"And she learned some great secret of Digby's,
which was the motive of the crime," I suggested.</p>

<p>But my love only shook her pretty head blankly,
saying&mdash;"I don't know. Perhaps she knew something
to his detriment."</p>

<p>"And in order to silence her, she was killed,"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>She made no protest of her own innocence, I
noticed. She seemed to place herself unreservedly
in my hands to judge her as I thought fit.</p>

<p>Yet had not her own admissions been extremely
strange ones. Had she not practically avowed
her guilt?</p>

<p>"Can you tell me nothing concerning this Belgian
girl?" I asked her a few moments later.</p>

<p>"I only knew her but very slightly."</p>

<p>"Pardon me putting to you such a pointed
question, Phrida. But were you jealous of
her?"</p>

<p>"Jealous!" she ejaculated. "Why, dear me,
no. Why should I be jealous? Who suggested
that?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Petre. She declares that your jealousy
was the motive of the crime, and that Digby himself
can bear witness to it."</p>

<p>"She said that?" cried my love, her eyes
flashing in fierce anger. "She's a wicked liar."</p>

<p>"I know she is, and I intend to prove her so,"
I replied with confidence. "When she and I
meet again we have an account to settle. You
will see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! Teddy, beware of her! She's a dangerous
woman&mdash;highly dangerous," declared my love apprehensively.
"You don't know her as I do&mdash;you
do not know the grave evil and utter ruin she
has brought upon others. So I beg of you to be
careful not to be entrapped."</p>

<p>"Have others been entrapped, then?" I asked
with great curiosity.</p>

<p>"I don't know. No. Please don't ask me,"
she protested. "I don't know."</p>

<p>Her response was unreal. My well-beloved was
I knew in possession of some terrible secret which
she dared not betray. Yet why were her lips sealed?
What did she fear?</p>

<p>"I intend to find Digby, and demand the truth
from him," I said after we had been silent for a
long time. "I will never rest until I stand before
him face to face."</p>

<p>"Ah! no dear!" she cried in quick alarm, starting
up and flinging both her arms about my neck. "No,
don't do that?" she implored.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because he will condemn me&mdash;he will think
you have learned something from me," she declared
in deep distress.</p>

<p>"But I shall reveal to him my sources of information,"
I said. "Since that fatal night I have
learned that the man whom I believed was my
firm friend has betrayed me. An explanation is
due to me, and I intend to have one."</p>

<p>"At my expense&mdash;eh?" she asked in bitter
reproach.</p>

<p>"No, dearest. The result shall not fall upon you,"
I said. "I will see to that. A foul and dastardly
crime has been committed, and the assassin shall be
brought to punishment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>My well-beloved shuddered in my arms as she
heard my words&mdash;as though the guilt were upon
her.</p>

<p>I detected it, and became more than ever puzzled.
Why did she seek to secure this man's freedom?</p>

<p>I asked her that question point-blank, whereupon
in a hard, faltering voice, she replied:</p>

<p>"Because, dear, while he is still a fugitive from
justice I feel myself safe. The hour he is arrested
is the hour of my doom."</p>

<p>"Why speak so despondently?" I asked. "Have
I not promised to protect you from those people?"</p>

<p>"How can you if they make allegations against
me and bring up witnesses who will commit perjury&mdash;who
will swear anything in order that the guilt
shall be placed upon my head," she asked in
despair.</p>

<p>"Though the justice often dispensed by country
magistrates is a disgraceful travesty of right and
wrong, yet we still have in England justice in
the criminal courts," I said. "Rest assured
that no jury will convict an innocent woman of the
crime of murder."</p>

<p>She stood slightly away from me, staring blankly
straight before her. Then suddenly she pressed
both hands upon her brow and cried in a low,
intense voice:</p>

<p>"May God have pity on me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said very earnestly. "Trust in Him,
dearest, and He will help you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried. "You don't know how I
suffer&mdash;of all the terror&mdash;all the dread that haunts
me night and day. Each ring at the door I fear may
be the police&mdash;every man who passes the house I
fear may be a detective watching. This torture is
too awful. I feel I shall go mad&mdash;<i>mad</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>And she paced the room in her despair, while I
stood watching her, unable to still the wild, frantic
terror that had gripped her young heart.</p>

<p>What could I do? What could I think?</p>

<p>"This cannot go on, Phrida!" I cried at last in
desperation. "I will search out this man. I'll
grip him by the throat and force the truth from him,"
I declared, setting my teeth hard. "I love you,
and I will not stand by and see you suffer like
this!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" she implored, suddenly approaching
me, flinging herself upon her knees and gripping
my hands. "No, I beg of you not to do that!"
she cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>"But why?" I demanded. "Surely you can
tell me the reason of your fear!" I went on&mdash;"the
man is a rank impostor. That has been proved
already by the police."</p>

<p>"Do you know that?" she asked, in an instant
grave. "Are you quite certain of that? Remember,
you have all along believed him to be the real
Sir Digby."</p>

<p>"What is your belief, Phrida?" I asked her very
earnestly.</p>

<p>She drew a long breath and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Truth to tell, dear, I don't know what to think.
Sometimes I believe he must be the real person&mdash;and
at other times I am filled with doubt."</p>

<p>"But now tell me," I urged, assisting her to rise
to her feet and then placing my arm about her neck,
so that her pretty head fell upon my shoulder.
"Answer me truthfully this one question, for all
depends upon it. How is it that this man has
secured such a hold upon you&mdash;how is it that with
you his word is law&mdash;that though he is a fugitive
from justice you refuse to say a single word against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
him or to give me one clue to the solution of this
mystery?"</p>

<p>Her face was blanched to the lips, she trembled
in my embrace, drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm sorry, dear&mdash;but I&mdash;I can't tell
you. I&mdash;I dare not. Can't you understand?" she
asked with despair in her great, wide-open eyes.
"<i>I dare not!</i>"</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>OFFICIAL SECRECY.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> following evening was damp, grey, and dull,
as I stood shivering at the corner of the narrow
Rue de l'Eveque and the broad Place de la Monnie
in Brussels. The lamps were lit, and around me
everywhere was the bustle of business.</p>

<p>I had crossed by the morning service by way of
Ostend, and had arrived again at the Grand only
half an hour before.</p>

<p>The woman Petre had sent a letter to Digby
Kemsley to the Poste Restante in Brussels under
the name of Bryant. If this were so, the fugitive
must be in the habit of calling for his letters, and
it was the great black fa&ccedil;ade of the chief post-office
in Brussels that I was watching.</p>

<p>The business-day was just drawing to a close,
the streets were thronged, the traffic rattled noisily
over the uneven granite paving of the big square.
Opposite the Post Office the arc lamps were shedding
a bright light outside the theatre, while all the shops
around were a blaze of light, while on every side
the streets were agog with life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Up and down the broad flight of steps which
led to the entrance of the Post Office hundreds
of people ascended and descended, passing and
re-passing the four swing-doors which gave entrance
to the huge hall with its dozens of departments
ranged around and its partitioned desks
for writing.</p>

<p>The mails from France and England were just
in, and dozens of men came with their keys to
obtain their correspondence from the range of
private boxes, and as I watched, the whole bustle of
business life passed before me.</p>

<p>I was keeping a sharp eye upon all who passed
up and down that long flight of granite steps, but
at that hour of the evening, and in that crowd, it
was no easy matter.</p>

<p>Would I be successful? That was the one
thought which filled my mind.</p>

<p>As I stood there, my eager gaze upon that endless
stream of people, I felt wearied and fagged. The
Channel crossing had been a bad one, as it so often
is in January, and I had not yet recovered from
my weird experience at Colchester. The heavy
overcoat I wore was, I found, not proof against
the cutting east wind which swept around the
corner from the Boulevard Auspach, hence I was
compelled to change my position and seek shelter
in a doorway opposite the point where I expected
the man I sought would enter.</p>

<p>I had already surveyed the interior and presented
the card of a friend to an official at
the Poste Restante, though I knew there was no
letter for him. I uttered some words of politeness
to the man in order to make his acquaintance, as
he might, perhaps, be of use to me ere my quest
was at an end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Poste Restante were two windows, one
distributing correspondence for people whose surname
began with the letters A to L, and the other
from M to Z.</p>

<p>It was at the first window I inquired, the clerk
there being a pleasant, fair-haired, middle-aged
man in a holland coat as worn by postal employees.
I longed to ask him if he had any letters for the
name of Bryant, or if any Englishman of that
name had called, but I dared not do so. He would,
no doubt, snub me and tell me to mind my own
business.</p>

<p>So instead, I was extremely polite, regretted to
have troubled him, and, raising my hat, withdrew.</p>

<p>I saw that to remain within the big office for
hours was impossible. The uniformed doorkeeper
who sat upon a high desk overlooking everything,
would quickly demand my business, and
expel me.</p>

<p>No, my only place was out in the open street.
Not a pleasant prospect in winter, and for how many
days I could not tell.</p>

<p>For aught I knew, the fugitive had called for
the woman's letter and left the capital. But he,
being aware that the police were in search of him,
would, I thought, if he called at the post office at
all for letters, come there after dark. Hence, I
had lost no time in mounting guard.</p>

<p>My thoughts, as I stood there, were, indeed, bitter
and confused.</p>

<p>The woman Petre had not, as far as I could make
out, made any incriminating statement to the
police. Yet she undoubtedly believed me to be
dead, and I reflected in triumph upon the unpleasant
surprise in store for her when we met&mdash;as meet we
undoubtedly would.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The amazing problem, viewed briefly, stood
thus: The girl, Marie Bracq, had been killed by a
knife with a three-cornered blade, such knife having
been and being still in the possession of Phrida, my
well-beloved, whose finger-prints were found in
the room near the body of the poor girl. The
grave and terrible suspicion resting upon Phrida
was increased and even corroborated by her firm
resolve to preserve secrecy, her admissions, and her
avowed determination to take her own life rather
than face accusation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was the mystery of the
identity of Marie Bracq, the mystery of the identity
of the man who had passed as Sir Digby Kemsley,
the reason of his flight, if Phrida were guilty,
and the mystery of the woman Petre, and her
accomplices.</p>

<p>Yes. The whole affair was one great and complete
problem, the extent of which even Edwards,
expert as he was, had, as yet, failed to discover.
The more I tried to solve it the more hopelessly
complicated did it become.</p>

<p>I could see no light through the veil of mystery
and suspicion in which my well-beloved had
become enveloped.</p>

<p>Why had that man&mdash;the man I now hated with
so fierce an hatred&mdash;held her in the hollow of his
unscrupulous hands? She had admitted that,
whenever he ordered her to do any action, she was
bound to obey.</p>

<p>Yes. My love was that man's slave! I ground
my teeth when the bitter thought flashed across
my perturbed mind.</p>

<p>Ah! what a poor, ignorant fool I had been!
And how that scoundrel must have laughed
at me!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>I was anxious to meet him face to face&mdash;to
force from his lips the truth, to compel him to
answer to me.</p>

<p>And with that object I waited&mdash;waited in
the cold and rain for three long hours, until
at last the great doors were closed and locked
for the night, and people ascended those steps
no longer.</p>

<p>Then I turned away faint and disheartened,
chilled to the bone, and wearied out. A few
steps along the Boulevard brought me to
the hotel, where I ate some dinner, and retired
to my room to fling myself upon the couch
and think.</p>

<p>Why was Phrida in such fear lest I should meet
the man who held her so mysteriously and completely
in his power? What could she fear from
our meeting if she were, as I still tried to believe,
innocent?</p>

<p>Again, was it possible that after their dastardly
attempt upon my life, Mrs. Petre and her accomplices
had fled to join the fugitive? Were they
with him? Perhaps so! Perhaps they were there
in Brussels!</p>

<p>The unfortunate victim, Marie Bracq, had
probably been a Belgian. Bracq was certainly a
Belgian name.</p>

<p>The idea crossed my mind to go on the following
day to the central Police Bureau I had noticed in
the Rue de la Regence, and make inquiry whether
they knew of any person of that name to be missing.
It was not a bad suggestion, I reflected, and I felt
greatly inclined to carry it out.</p>

<p>Next day, I was up early, but recognised the
futility of watching at the Poste Restante until the
daylight faded. On the other hand, if Mrs. Petre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
was actually in that city, she would have no fear
to go about openly. Yet, after due consideration,
I decided not to go to the post office till twilight
set in.</p>

<p>The morning I spent idling on the Boulevards
and in the caf&eacute;s, but I became sick of such inactivity,
for I was frantically eager and anxious to
learn the truth.</p>

<p>At noon I made up my mind, and taking a taxi,
alighted at the Pr&eacute;fecture of Police, where, after
some time, I was seen by the <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i>, a grey-haired,
dry-as-dust looking official&mdash;a narrow-eyed
little man, in black, whose name was Monsieur
Van Huffel, and who sat at a writing-table in a
rather bare room, the walls of which were painted
dark green. He eyed me with some curiosity
as I entered and bowed.</p>

<p>"Be seated, I pray, m'sieur," he said in French,
indicating a chair on the opposite side of the table,
and leaning back, placed his fingers together in a
judicial attitude.</p>

<p>The police functionary on the continent is possessed
of an ultra-grave demeanour, and is always
of a funereal type.</p>

<p>"M'sieur wishes to make an inquiry, I hear?"
he began.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I am very anxious to know
whether you have any report of a young person
named Marie Bracq being missing."</p>

<p>"Marie Bracq!" he echoed in surprise, leaning
forward towards me. "And what do you know,
m'sieur, regarding Marie Bracq?"</p>

<p>"I merely called to ascertain if any person of
that name, is reported to you as missing," I said,
much surprised at the effect which mention of the
victim had produced upon him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are English, of course?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'sieur."</p>

<p>"Well, curiously enough, only this morning I
have had a similar inquiry from your Scotland
Yard. They are asking if we are acquainted with
any person named Marie Bracq. And we are,
m'sieur," said Monsieur Van Huffel. "But first
please explain what you know of her."</p>

<p>"I have no personal acquaintance with her," was
my reply. "I know of her&mdash;that is all. But it may
not be the same person."</p>

<p>He opened a drawer, turned over a quantity
of papers, and a few seconds later produced a
photograph which he passed across to me.</p>

<p>It was a half-length cabinet portrait of a girl
in a fur coat and hat. But no second glance was
needed to tell me that it was actually the picture of
the girl found murdered in London.</p>

<p>"I see you recognise her, m'sieur," remarked
the police official in a cold, matter-of-fact tone.
"Please tell me all you know."</p>

<p>I paused for a few seconds with the portrait in
my hand. My object was to get all the facts I
could from the functionary before me, and give
him the least information possible.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, I know but very little," was my
rather lame reply. "This lady was a friend of a
lady friend of mine."</p>

<p>"An English lady was your friend&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In London?"</p>

<p>I nodded in the affirmative, while the shrewd little
man who was questioning me sat twiddling a pen
with his thin fingers.</p>

<p>"And she told you of Marie Bracq? In what
circumstances?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," I said. "It is a long story. Before I
tell you, I would like to ask you one question,
m'sieur. Have you received from Scotland Yard
the description of a man named Digby Kemsley&mdash;Sir
Digby Kemsley&mdash;who is wanted for
murder?"</p>

<p>The dry little official with the parchment face
repeated the name, then consulting a book at his
elbow, replied:</p>

<p>"Yes. We have circulated the description and
photograph. It is believed by your police that his
real name is Cane."</p>

<p>"He has been in Brussels during the past few
days to my own certain knowledge," I said.</p>

<p>"In Brussels," echoed the man seated in the
writing chair. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Here, in your city. And I expect he is
here now."</p>

<p>"And you know him?" asked the <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i>,
his eyes betraying slight excitement.</p>

<p>"Quite well. He was my friend."</p>

<p>"I see he is accused of murdering a woman,
name unknown, in his apartment," remarked
the official.</p>

<p>"The name is now known&mdash;it has been discovered
by me, m'sieur. The name of the dead
girl is Marie Bracq."</p>

<p>The little man half rose from his chair and stared
at me.</p>

<p>"Is this the truth, m'sieur?" he cried. "Is
this man named Kemsley, or Cane, accused of the
assassination of Marie Bracq?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"But this is most astounding," the Belgian
functionary declared excitedly. "Marie Bracq
dead! Ah! it cannot be possible, m'sieur! You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
do not know what this information means to us&mdash;what
an enormous sensation it will cause if the
press scents the truth. Tell me quickly&mdash;tell me
all you know," he urged, at the same time taking
up the telephone receiver from his table and then
listening for a second, said in a quick, impetuous
voice, "I want Inspector Fr&eacute;my at once!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>FR&Eacute;MY, OF THE SURET&Eacute;.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">After</span> a few moments a short, stout, clean-shaven
man with a round, pleasant face, and dressed in
black, entered and bowed to his chief.</p>

<p>He carried his soft felt hat and cane in his
hand, and seated himself at the invitation of
Van Huffel.</p>

<p>"This is Inspector Fr&eacute;my&mdash;Monsieur Edouard
Royle, of Londres," exclaimed the <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i>,
introducing us.</p>

<p>The detective, the most famous police officer in
Belgium, who had been for years under Monsieur
Hennion, in Paris, and had now transferred his
services to Belgium, bowed and looked at me with
his small, inquisitive eyes.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Fr&eacute;my. This gentleman has called
with regard to the case of Marie Bracq," said Van
Huffel in French.</p>

<p>The detective was quickly interested.</p>

<p>"She is dead&mdash;been assassinated in London,"
his chief went on.</p>

<p>Fr&eacute;my stared at the speaker in surprise, and
the two men exchanged strange glances.</p>

<p>"Monsieur tells me that the man, Sir Digby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Kemsley, wanted by Scotland Yard, is accused
of the murder of Marie Bracq&mdash;and, further,"
added Van Huffel, "the accused has been
here in Brussels quite recently."</p>

<p>"In Brussels?" echoed the round-faced man.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "He has letters addressed to
the Poste Restante in the name of Bryant." And
I spelt it as the detective carefully wrote down
the name.</p>

<p>"He will not be difficult to find if he is still in
Brussels," declared the inspector. "We had an
inquiry from Scotland Yard asking if we had any
report concerning Marie Bracq only this morning,"
he added.</p>

<p>"It was sent to you by my friend, Inspector
Edwards, and whom I am assisting in this inquiry,"
I explained.</p>

<p>"You said that Marie Bracq was a friend
of a lady friend of yours, M'sieur Royle,"
continued the <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i>. "Will you do
us the favour and tell us all you know concerning
the tragedy&mdash;how the young lady lost
her life?"</p>

<p>"Ah! m'sieur," I replied, "I fear I cannot do
that. How she was killed is still a mystery. Only
within the past few hours have I been able to establish
the dead girl's identity, and only then
after narrowly escaping falling the victim of a most
dastardly plot."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will be good enough to make a
statement of all you know, M'sieur Royle," urged
the grey-haired little man; "and if we can be
of any service in bringing the culprit to justice,
you may rely upon us."</p>

<p>"But first, m'sieur, allow me to put observation
upon the Poste Restante?" asked Fr&eacute;my, rising and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
going to the telephone, where he got on to one of
his subordinates, and gave him instructions in
Flemish, a language I do not understand.</p>

<p>Then, when he returned to his chair, I began
to briefly relate what I knew concerning Sir Digby,
and what had occurred, as far as I knew, on that
fatal night of the sixth of January.</p>

<p>I, of course, made no mention of the black suspicion
cast upon the woman I loved, nor of the
delivery of Digby's letter, my meeting with the
woman Petre and its exciting results.</p>

<p>Yet had I not met that woman I should still
have been in ignorance of the identity of the
dead girl, and, besides, I would not have met
the sallow-faced Ali, or been aware of his
methods&mdash;those methods so strangely similar to
that adopted when Sir Digby Kemsley lost his
life in Peru.</p>

<p>The two police functionaries listened very attentively
to my story without uttering a word.</p>

<p>I had spoken of the woman Petre as being
an accomplice of the man who was a fugitive,
whereupon Fr&eacute;my asked:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that the woman is with him?"</p>

<p>"She has, I believe, left England, and, therefore,
in all probability, is with him."</p>

<p>"Are there any others of the gang&mdash;for there
is, of course, a gang? Such people never act
singly."</p>

<p>"Two other men, as far as I know. One, a young
man, who acts as servant, and the other, a tall,
copper-faced man with sleek black hair&mdash;probably
a Peruvian native. They call him Ali, and he
pretends he is a Hindu."</p>

<p>"A Hindu!" gasped the detective. "Why,
I saw one talking to a rather stout Englishwoman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
at the Gare du Nord yesterday evening, just before
the Orient Express left for the East!" He gave
a quick description of both the man and the woman,
and I at once said:</p>

<p>"Yes, that was certainly Ali, and the woman was
Mrs. Petre!"</p>

<p>"They probably left by the Orient Express!"
he cried, starting up, and crossing to his chief's
table snatched up the orange-coloured official
time table.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes," he exclaimed, after searching a
few moments. "The Orient Express will reach
Wels, in Austria, at 2.17, no time for a telegram
to get through. No. The next stop is Vienna&mdash;the
Westbahnhof&mdash;at 6. I will wire to the Commissary
of Police to board the train, and if they are
in it, to detain them."</p>

<p>"Excellent," remarked his chief, and, ringing a
bell, a clerk appeared and took down the official
telegram, giving the description of the woman and
her accomplice.</p>

<p>"I suppose the fugitive Englishman is not with
them?" suggested the <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"I did not see him at the station&mdash;or, at least, I
did not recognise anyone answering to the description,"
replied the inspector; "but we may as well
add his description in the telegram and ask for an
immediate reply."</p>

<p>Thereupon the official description of Digby,
as supplied to the Belgian police by Scotland
Yard, was translated into French and placed in the
message.</p>

<p>After the clerk had left with it, Fr&eacute;my, standing
near the window, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Dieu! Had I but known who they were last
night! But we may still get them. I will see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
employ&eacute;e at the Poste Restante. This Monsieur
Bryant, if he receives letters, may have given an
address for them to be forwarded."</p>

<p>After a slight pause, during which time the two
functionaries conversed in Flemish, I turned to
Van Huffel, and said:</p>

<p>"I have related all I know, m'sieur; therefore,
I beg of you to tell me something concerning
the young person Marie Bracq. Was she
a lady?"</p>

<p>"A lady!" he echoed with a laugh. "Most
certainly&mdash;the daughter of one of the princely
houses of Europe."</p>

<p>"What?" I gasped. "Tell me all about her!"</p>

<p>But the dry-as-dust little man shook his grey
head and replied:</p>

<p>"I fear, m'sieur, in my position, I am not permitted
to reveal secrets entrusted to me. And her
identity is a secret&mdash;a great secret."</p>

<p>"But I have discovered her identity where our
English police had failed!" I protested. "Besides,
am I not assisting you?"</p>

<p>"Very greatly, and we are greatly indebted
to you, M'sieur Royle," he replied, with exquisite
politeness; "but it is not within my province
as <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i> to tell you facts which have been
revealed to me under pledge of secrecy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps M'sieur Fr&eacute;my may be able to tell me
some facts," I suggested. "Remember, I am
greatly interested in the mysterious affair."</p>

<p>"From mere curiosity&mdash;eh?" asked Van Huffel
with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, m'sieur," was my earnest reply. "Because
the arrest and condemnation of the assassin of
Marie Bracq means all the world to me."</p>

<p>"How?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>I hesitated for some moments, then, hoping to
enlist his sympathy, I told him the truth.</p>

<p>"Upon the lady who is my promised wife rests
a grave suspicion," I said, in a low, hard voice. "I
decline to believe ill of her, or to think that she
could be guilty of a crime, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of the assassination of Marie Bracq?" interrupted
Van Huffel. "Do you suspect that?
Is there any question as to the guilt of the man
Kemsley?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"No one has any suspicion of the lady in question,"
I said. "Only&mdash;only from certain facts
within my knowledge and certain words which
she herself has uttered, a terrible and horrible
thought has seized me."</p>

<p>"That Marie Bracq was killed by her hand&mdash;eh?
Ah, m'sieur, I quite understand," he said.
"And you are seeking the truth&mdash;in order to clear
the woman you love?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. That is the truth. That is why I
am devoting all my time&mdash;all that I possess in
order to solve the mystery and get at the actual
truth."</p>

<p>Fr&eacute;my glanced at his chief, then at me.</p>

<p>"Bien, m'sieur," exclaimed Van Huffel. "But
there is no great necessity for you to know the
actual identity of Marie Bracq. So long as you
are able to remove the stigma from the lady
in question, who is to be your wife, and to
whom you are undoubtedly devoted, what matters
whether the dead girl was the daughter of a
prince or of a rag-picker? We will assist you
in every degree in our power," he went on.
"M'sieur Fr&eacute;my will question the postal clerk,
watch will be kept at the Poste Restante, at
each of the railway stations, and in various other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
quarters, so that if any of the gang are in the city
they cannot leave it without detection&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except by automobile," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see m'sieur possesses forethought,"
he said with a smile. "Of course, they can easily
hire an automobile and run to Namur, Ghent, or
Antwerp&mdash;or even to one or other of the frontiers.
But M'sieur Fr&eacute;my is in touch with all persons
who have motor-cars for hire. If they attempted
to leave by car when once their descriptions are
circulated, we should know in half an hour, while
to cross the frontier by car would be impossible."
Then, turning to the inspector, he said, "You will
see that precautions are immediately taken that if
they are here they cannot leave."</p>

<p>"The matter is in my hands, m'sieur," answered
the great detective simply.</p>

<p>"Then m'sieur refuses to satisfy me as to the
exact identity of Marie Bracq?" I asked Van
Huffel in my most persuasive tone.</p>

<p>"A thousand regrets, m'sieur, but as I have
already explained, I am compelled to regard the
secret entrusted to me."</p>

<p>"I take it that her real name is not Marie
Bracq?" I said, looking him in the face.</p>

<p>"You are correct. It is not."</p>

<p>"Is she a Belgian subject?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, m'sieur, the lady is not."</p>

<p>"You said that a great sensation would be caused
if the press knew the truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I ask you to do me the favour, and
promise me absolute secrecy in this matter. If we
are to be successful in the arrest of these individuals,
then the press must know nothing&mdash;not a syllable.
Do I have your promise, M'sieur Royle?"</p>

<p>"If you wish," I answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we on our part will assist you to clear
this lady who is to be your wife&mdash;but upon one
condition."</p>

<p>"And that is what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That you do not seek to inquire into the real
identity of the poor young lady who has lost her life&mdash;the
lady known to you and others as Marie
Bracq," he said, looking straight into my eyes
very seriously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>SHOWS EXPERT METHODS.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">It</span> being the luncheon hour, Fr&eacute;my and myself
ate our meal at the highly popular restaurant,
the Taverne Joseph, close to the Bourse, where
the cooking is, perhaps, the best in Brussels
and where the cosmopolitan, who knows where
to eat, usually makes for when in the Belgian
capital.</p>

<p>After our coffee, cigarettes, and a "triple-sec"
each, we strolled round to the General Post Office.
As we approached that long flight of granite steps I
knew so well, a poor-looking, ill-dressed man with
the pinch of poverty upon his face, and his coat
buttoned tightly against the cold, edged up to my
companion on the pavement and whispered a word,
afterwards hurrying on.</p>

<p>"Our interesting friend has not been here
yet," the detective remarked to me. "We
will have a talk with the clerk at the Poste
Restante."</p>

<p>Entering the great hall, busy as it is all day,
we approached the window where letters were
distributed from A to L, and where sat the same
pleasant, fair-haired man sorting letters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bon jour, m'sieur!" he exclaimed, when he
caught sight of Fr&eacute;my. "What weather, eh?"</p>

<p>The great detective returned his greetings,
and then putting his head further into the window
so that others should not overhear, said in
French:</p>

<p>"I am looking for an individual, an Englishman,
name of Bryant, and am keeping watch outside.
He is wanted in England for a serious offence.
Has he been here?"</p>

<p>"Bryant?" repeated the clerk thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fr&eacute;my, and then I spelt the
name slowly.</p>

<p>The clerk reached his hand to the pigeon-hole
wherein were letters for callers whose names began
with B, and placing them against a little block of
black wood on the counter before him, looked eagerly
through while we watched intently.</p>

<p>Once or twice he stopped to scrutinise an address,
but his fingers went on again through the letters
to the end.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he remarked laconically, replacing
the packet in the pigeon-hole. "But there has been
correspondence for him. I recollect&mdash;a thin-faced
man, with grey hair and clean shaven. Yes. I
remember him distinctly. He always called just
before the office was closed."</p>

<p>"When did he call last?" asked Fr&eacute;my
quickly.</p>

<p>"The night before last, I think," was the man's
answer. "A lady was with him&mdash;a rather stout
English lady."</p>

<p>We both started.</p>

<p>"Did the lady ask for any letters?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I forget the name."</p>

<p>"Petre is her right name," I interrupted. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
I suggested to Fr&eacute;my: "Ask the other clerk to look
through the letter 'P.'"</p>

<p>"Non, m'sieur!" exclaimed the fair-haired employ&eacute;e.
"The name she asked for was in my division.
It was not P."</p>

<p>"Then she must have asked for a name that
was not her own," I said.</p>

<p>"And it seems very much as though we have lost
the gang by a few hours," Fr&eacute;my said disappointedly.
"My own opinion is that they left Brussels by the
Orient Express last night. They did not call at
the usual time yesterday."</p>

<p>"They may come this evening," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Certainly they may. We shall, of course,
watch," he replied.</p>

<p>"When the man and woman called the day
before yesterday," continued the employ&eacute;e, "there
was a second man&mdash;a dark-faced Indian with them,
I believe. He stood some distance away, and
followed them out. It was his presence which
attracted my attention and caused me to remember
the incident."</p>

<p>Fr&eacute;my exchanged looks with me. I knew he was
cursing his fate which had allowed the precious
trio to slip through his fingers.</p>

<p>Yet the thought was gratifying that when the
express ran into the Great Westbahnhof at Vienna,
the detectives would at once search it for the
fugitives.</p>

<p>My companion had told me that by eight o'clock
we would know the result of the enquiry, and I was
anxious for that hour to arrive.</p>

<p>Already Fr&eacute;my had ordered search to be made of
arrivals at all hotels and pensions in the city for
the name of Bryant, therefore, we could do nothing
more than possess ourselves in patience. So we left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
the post office, his poverty-stricken assistant remaining
on the watch, just as I had watched in
the cold on the previous night.</p>

<p>With my companion I walked round to the big
Caf&eacute; Metropole on the Boulevard, and over our
"bocks," at a table where we could not be overheard,
we discussed the situation.</p>

<p>That big caf&eacute;, one of the principal in Brussels, is
usually deserted between the hours of three and
four. At other times it is filled with business
men discussing their affairs, or playing dominoes
with that rattle which is characteristic of the
foreign caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>"Why is it," I asked him, "that your chief
absolutely refuses to betray the identity of the
girl Marie Bracq?"</p>

<p>The round-faced man before me smiled thoughtfully
as he idly puffed his cigarette. Then, shrugging
his shoulders, he replied:</p>

<p>"Well, m'sieur, to tell the truth, there is a very
curious complication. In connection with the
affair there is a scandal which must never be allowed
to get out to the public."</p>

<p>"Then you know the truth&mdash;eh?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A portion of it. Not all," he replied. "But I
tell you that the news of the young lady's death
has caused us the greatest amazement and surprise.
We knew that she was missing, but never
dreamed that she had been the victim of an
assassin."</p>

<p>"But who are her friends?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, I am not permitted to say,"
was his response. "When they know the terrible
truth they may give us permission to reveal the
truth to you. Till then, my duty is to preserve
their secret."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I am all anxiety to know."</p>

<p>"I quite recognise that, M'sieur Royle," he said.
"I know how I should feel were I in your position.
But duty is duty, is it not?"</p>

<p>"I have assisted you, and I have given you a clue
to the mystery," I protested.</p>

<p>"And we, on our part, will assist you to clear the
stigma resting upon the lady who is your promised
wife," he said. "Whatever I can do in that direction,
m'sieur may rely upon me."</p>

<p>I was silent, for I saw that to attempt to probe
further then the mystery of the actual identity
of Marie Bracq was impossible. There seemed a
conspiracy of silence against me.</p>

<p>But I would work myself. I would exert all
the cunning and ingenuity I possessed&mdash;nay, I would
spend every penny I had in the world&mdash;in order to
clear my well-beloved of that terrible suspicion
that by her hand this daughter of a princely house
had fallen.</p>

<p>"Well," I asked at last. "What more can
we do?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the stout man, blowing a cloud
of cigarette smoke from his lips and drawing his
glass. "What can we do? The Poste Restante
is being watched, the records of all hotels and pensions
for the past month are being inspected, and
we have put a guard upon the Orient Express. No!
We can do nothing," he said, "until we get a telegram
from Vienna. Will you call at the Pr&eacute;fecture
of Police at eight o'clock to-night? I will be there
to see you."</p>

<p>I promised, then having paid the waiter, we
strolled out of the caf&eacute;, and parted on the Boulevard,
he going towards the Nord Station, while I
went along in the opposite direction to the Grand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>For the appointed hour I waited in greatest
anxiety. What if the trio had been arrested in
Vienna?</p>

<p>That afternoon I wrote a long and encouraging
letter to Phrida, telling her that I was exerting
every effort on her behalf and urging her to keep
a stout heart against her enemies, who now seemed
to be in full flight.</p>

<p>At last, eight o'clock came, and I entered the
small courtyard of the Pr&eacute;fecture of Police, where
a uniformed official conducted me up to the room
of Inspector Fr&eacute;my.</p>

<p>The big, merry-faced man rose as I entered and
placed his cigar in an ash tray.</p>

<p>"Bad luck, m'sieur!" he exclaimed in French.
"They left Brussels in the Orient, as I suspected&mdash;all
three of them. Here is the reply," and he handed
me an official telegram in German, which translated
into English read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To Pr&eacute;fet of Police, Brussels, from Pr&eacute;fet
of Police, Vienna:</p>

<p>"In response to telegram of to-day's date, the
three persons described left Brussels by Orient
Express, travelled to Wels, and there left the
train at 2.17 this afternoon. Telephonic inquiry
of police at Wels results that they left at 4.10 by
the express for Paris."</p></div>

<p>"I have already telegraphed to Paris," Fr&eacute;my
said. "But there is time, of course, to get across
to Paris, and meet the express from Constantinople
on its arrival there. Our friends evidently know
their way about the Continent!"</p>

<p>"Shall we go to Paris," I suggested eagerly, anticipating
in triumph their arrest as they alighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
at the Gare de l'Est. I had travelled by the express
from Vienna on one occasion about a year before,
and remembered that it arrived in Paris about nine
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"With the permission of my chief I will willingly
accompany you, m'sieur," replied the detective, and,
leaving me, he was absent for five minutes or
so, while I sat gazing around his bare, official-looking
bureau, where upon the walls were many police
notices and photographs of wanted persons, "rats
d'hotel," and other malefactors. Brussels is one of
the most important police centres in Europe, as
well as being the centre of the political secret service
of the Powers.</p>

<p>On his return he said:</p>

<p>"Bien, m'sieur. We leave the Midi Station at
midnight and arrive in Paris at half-past five.
I will engage sleeping berths, and I will telephone
to my friend, Inspector Dricot, at the Pr&eacute;fecture,
to send an agent of the brigade mobile to meet us.
Non d'un chien! What a surprise it will be for the
fugitives. But," he added, "they are clever and
elusive. Fancy, in order to go from Brussels to
Paris they travel right away into Austria, and
with through tickets to Belgrade, too! Yes,
they know the routes on the Continent&mdash;the
routes used by the international thieves, I mean.
The Wels route by which they travelled, is one of
them."</p>

<p>Then I left him, promising to meet him at the
station ten minutes before midnight. I had told
Edwards I would notify him by wire any change
of address, therefore, on leaving the Pr&eacute;fecture of
Police, I went to the Grand and from there sent
a telegram to him at Scotland Yard, telling him
that I should call at the office of the inspector of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
police at the East railway station in Paris at ten
on the following morning&mdash;if he had anything
to communicate.</p>

<p>All through that night we travelled on in the
close, stuffy <i>wagon-lit</i> by way of Mons to Paris
arriving with some three hours and a half to spare,
which we idled in one of the all-night caf&eacute;s near
the station, having been met by a little ferret-eyed
Frenchman, named Japp&eacute;, who had been
one of Fr&eacute;my's subordinates when he was in the
French service.</p>

<p>Just before nine o'clock, after our <i>caf&eacute;-au-lait</i> in
the buffet, we walked out upon the long arrival
platform where the Orient Express from its long
journey from Constantinople was due.</p>

<p>It was a quarter of an hour late, but at length
the luggage porters began to assemble, and with
bated breath I watched the train of dusty sleeping-cars
slowly draw into the terminus.</p>

<p>In a moment Fr&eacute;my and his colleague were all
eyes, while I stood near the engine waiting the
result of their quest.</p>

<p>But in five minutes the truth was plain. Fr&eacute;my
was in conversation with one of the brown-uniformed
conductors, who told him that the three passengers
we sought did join at Wels, but had left again
at Munich on the previous evening!</p>

<p>My heart sank. Our quest was in vain. They
had again eluded us!</p>

<p>"I will go to Munich," Fr&eacute;my said at once. "I
may find trace of them yet."</p>

<p>"And I will accompany you!" I exclaimed eagerly.
"They must not escape us."</p>

<p>But my plans were at once altered, and Fr&eacute;my
was compelled to leave for Germany alone, for at
the police office at the station half an hour later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
I received a brief message from Edwards urging me
to return to London immediately, and stating that
an important discovery had been made.</p>

<p>So I drove across to the Gare du Nord, and left
for London by the next train.</p>

<p>What, I wondered, had been discovered?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>EDWARDS BECOMES MORE PUZZLED.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">At</span> half-past seven on that same evening, Edwards,
in response to a telegram I sent him from Calais,
called upon me in Albemarle Street.</p>

<p>He looked extremely grave when he entered my
room. After Haines had taken his hat and coat
and we were alone, he said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, I have a rather painful communication
to make to you. I much regret it&mdash;but the
truth must be faced."</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked, in quick apprehension; "what
is it?"</p>

<p>"We have received from an anonymous correspondent&mdash;who
turns out to be the woman Petre,
whom you know&mdash;a letter making the gravest accusations
against Miss Shand. She denounces her
as the assassin of the girl Marie Bracq."</p>

<p>"It's a lie! a foul, abominable lie!" I cried
angrily. "I told you that she would seek to condemn
the woman I love."</p>

<p>"Yes, I recollect. But it is a clue which I am
in duty bound to investigate."</p>

<p>"You have not been to Miss Shand&mdash;you have
not yet questioned her?" I gasped anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not before I saw you," he replied. "I may as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
well tell you at once that I had some slight suspicion
that the young lady in question was acquainted
with your friend who posed as Sir Digby."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked.</p>

<p>He hesitated. "Well, I thought it most likely
that as you and he were such great friends, you
might have introduced them," he said, rather lamely.</p>

<p>"But surely you are not going to believe the
words of this woman Petre?" I cried. "Listen,
and I will tell you how she has already endeavoured
to take my life, and thus leave Miss Shand at
her mercy."</p>

<p>Then, as he sat listening, his feet stretched towards
the fender, I related in detail the startling
adventure which befel me at Colchester.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary, Mr. Royle!" he exclaimed, in
blank surprise. "Why, in heaven's name, didn't
you tell me this before! The snake! Why, that
is exactly the method used by Cane to secure the
death of the real Sir Digby!"</p>

<p>"What was the use of telling you?" I queried.
"What is the use even now? The woman has fled
and, at the same time, takes a dastardly revenge
upon the woman I love."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Royle," said the inspector, who,
in his dinner coat and black tie, presented the
appearance of the West End club man rather than
a police official. "Have you yourself any suspicion
that Miss Shand has knowledge of the affair?"</p>

<p>His question non-plussed me for the moment.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see you hesitate!" he exclaimed,
shrewdly. "You have a suspicion&mdash;now admit it."</p>

<p>He pressed me, and seeing that my demeanour
had, alas! betrayed my thoughts, I was compelled
to speak the truth.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, in a low, strained voice. "To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
tell you the truth, Edwards, there are certain facts
which I am utterly unable to understand&mdash;facts
which Miss Shand has admitted to me. But I
still refuse to believe that she is a murderess."</p>

<p>"Naturally," he remarked, and I thought I
detected a slightly sarcastic curl of the lips. "But
though Miss Shand is unaware of it, I have made
certain secret inquiries&mdash;inquiries which have given
astounding results," he said slowly. "I have,
unknown to the young lady, secured some of her
finger-prints, which, on comparison, have coincided
exactly with those found upon the glass-topped
table at Harrington Gardens, and also
with those which you brought to me so mysteriously."
And he added, "To be quite frank, it
was that action of yours which first aroused my
suspicion regarding Miss Shand. I saw that you
suspected some one&mdash;that you were trying to prove to
your own satisfaction that your theory was wrong."</p>

<p>I held my breath, cursing myself for such
injudicious action.</p>

<p>"Again, this letter from the woman Petre has
corroborated my apprehensions," he went on.
"Miss Shand was a friend of the man who called
himself Sir Digby. She met him clandestinely,
unknown, to you&mdash;eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Please do not question me, Edwards," I implored.
"This is all so extremely painful to me."</p>

<p>"I regret, but it is my duty, Mr. Royle,"
he replied in a tone of sympathy. "Is not my
suggestion the true one?"</p>

<p>I admitted that it was.</p>

<p>Then, in quick, brief sentences I told him of my
visit to the Pr&eacute;fecture of Police in Brussels and
all that I had discovered regarding the fugitives, to
which he listened most attentively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have not replied to my inquiry concerning
the dead girl Marie Bracq," he remarked
presently.</p>

<p>"They know her," I replied. "Van Huffel,
the <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i>, stood aghast when I told him that
the man Kemsley was wanted by you on a charge
of murdering her. He declared that the allegation
utterly astounded him, and that the press must
have no suspicion of the affair, as a great scandal
would result."</p>

<p>"But who is the girl?" he inquired quickly.</p>

<p>"Van Huffel refused to satisfy my curiosity.
He declared that her identity was a secret which
he was not permitted to divulge, but he added
when I pressed him, that she was a daughter of
one of the princely houses of Europe!"</p>

<p>Edwards stared at me.</p>

<p>"I wonder what is her real name?" he said,
reflectively. "Really, Mr. Royle, the affair grows
more and more interesting and puzzling."</p>

<p>"It does," I said, and then I related in detail
my fruitless journey to Paris, and how the three
fugitives had alighted at Munich from the westbound
express from the Near East, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Fr&eacute;my, whom I think you know, has gone
after them," I added.</p>

<p>"If Fr&eacute;my once gets on the scent he'll, no doubt,
find them," remarked my companion. "He's one
of the most astute and clever detectives in Europe.
So, if the case is in his hands, I'm quite contented
that all will be done to trace them."</p>

<p>For two hours we sat together, while I related
what the girl at Melbourne House had told me,
and, in fact, put before him practically all that I
have recorded in the foregoing pages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, at last, I stood before him boldly and asked:</p>

<p>"In face of all this, can you suspect Miss Shand?
Is she not that man's victim?"</p>

<p>He did not speak for several moments; his gaze
was fixed upon the fire.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, stirring himself at last, "to
tell you the truth, Mr. Royle, I'm just as puzzled
as you are. She may be the victim of this man we
know to be an unscrupulous adventurer, but, at the
same time, her hand may have used that triangular-bladed
knife which we have been unable to find."</p>

<p>The knife! I held my breath. Was it not lying
openly upon that table in the corner of the drawing-room
at Cromwell Road? Would not analysis
reveal upon it a trace of human blood? Would
not its possession in itself convict her?</p>

<p>"Then what is your intention?" I asked, at last.</p>

<p>"To see her and put a few questions, Mr. Royle,"
he answered slowly. "I know how much this must
pain you, bearing in mind your deep affection for the
young lady, but, unfortunately, it is my duty, and
I cannot see how such a course can be avoided."</p>

<p>"No. I beg of you not to do this," I implored.
"Keep what observation you like, but do not
approach her&mdash;at least, not yet. In her present
frame of mind, haunted by the shadow of the crime
and hemmed in by suspicion of which she cannot
clear herself, it would be fatal."</p>

<p>"Fatal! I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;she would take her own life," I said in
a low whisper.</p>

<p>"She has threatened&mdash;eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>I nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Then does not that, in itself, justify my decision
to see and question her?"</p>

<p>"No, it does not!" I protested. "She is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
guilty, but this terrible dread and anxiety is, I know,
gradually unbalancing her brain. She is a girl
of calm determination, and if she believed that
you suspected her she would be driven by sheer
terror to carry out her threat."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Most women threaten suicide at one time or
other of their lives. Their thoughts seem to revert
to romance as soon as they find themselves in a
corner. No," he added. "I never believe in threats
of suicide in either man or woman. Life is always
too precious for that, and especially if a woman
loves, as she does."</p>

<p>"You don't know her."</p>

<p>"No, but I know women, Mr. Royle&mdash;I know
all their idiosyncrasies as well as most men, I think,"
he said.</p>

<p>I begged him not to approach my well-beloved,
but he was inexorable.</p>

<p>"I must see her&mdash;and I must know the truth,"
he declared decisively.</p>

<p>But I implored again of him, begging him to
spare her&mdash;begged her life.</p>

<p>I had gripped him by the hand, and looking into
his face I pointed out that I had done and was
doing all I could to elucidate the mystery.</p>

<p>"At least," I cried, "you will wait until the
fugitives are arrested!"</p>

<p>"There is only one&mdash;the impostor," he said.
"There is no charge against the others."</p>

<p>"Then I will lay a charge to-night against the
woman Petre and the man Ali of attempting to kill
me." I said. "The two names can then be added
to the warrant."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "We'll go to the Yard,
and I will take your information."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you will not approach Phrida until you
hear something from Brussels&mdash;eh?" I asked
persuasively. "In the meantime, I will do all I
can. Leave Miss Shand to me."</p>

<p>"If I did it would be a grave dereliction of duty,"
he replied slowly.</p>

<p>"But is it a dereliction of duty to disregard
allegations made by a woman who has fled in that
man's company, and who is, we now know, his
accomplice?" I protested. "Did not you yourself
tell me that you, at Scotland Yard, always regarded
lightly any anonymous communication?"</p>

<p>"As a rule we do. But past history shows
that many have been genuine," he said. "Before
the commission of nearly all the Jack the Ripper
crimes there were anonymous letters, written in
red ink. We have them now framed and hanging
up in the Black Museum."</p>

<p>"But such letters are not denunciations. They
were promises of a further sensation," I argued.
"The triumphant and gleeful declarations of the
mad but mysterious assassin. No. Promise me,
Edwards, that you will postpone this projected
step of yours, which can, in any case, even though
my love be innocent, only result in dire disaster."</p>

<p>He saw how earnest was my appeal, and realised,
I think, the extreme gravity of the situation, and
how deeply it concerned me. He seemed, also,
to recognise that in discovering the name of the
victim and in going a second time to Brussels, I
had been able to considerably advance the most
difficult inquiry; therefore, after still another
quarter of an hour of persuasion, I induced him
to withhold.</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied, "though I can make no
definite promise, Mr. Royle. I will not see the lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
before I have again consulted with you. But,"
he added, "I must be frank with you. I shall
continue my investigations in that quarter, and
most probably watch will be kept upon her
movements."</p>

<p>"And if she recognises that you suspect her?"
I gasped.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, with a slight shrug of the
shoulders. "I cannot accept any responsibility
for that. How can I?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<h3>FURTHER ADMISSIONS.</h3>


<p class="gap2">"<span class="smcap">The</span> secret of Digby Kemsley is still a secret,
and will ever remain a secret."</p>

<p>I recollected Mrs. Petre uttering those words to me
as that dark-faced villain Ali had forced my inert
head down upon the table.</p>

<p>Well, that same night when I had begged of
Edwards my love's life, I sat in his room at Scotland
Yard and there made a formal declaration of what
had happened to me on that well-remembered
night outside Colchester. I formally demanded
the arrest of the woman, of Ali, and of the young
man-servant, all of whom had conspired to take
my life.</p>

<p>The clerk calmly took down my statement, which
Edwards read over to me, and I duly signed it.</p>

<p>Then, gripping his hand, I went forth into Parliament
Street, and took a taxi to Cromwell Road.</p>

<p>I had not seen Phrida for several days, and she
was delighted at my visit.</p>

<p>She presented a pale, frail, little figure in her
simple gown of pale pink ninon, cut slightly open
at the neck and girdled narrow with turquoise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
blue. Her skirt was narrow, as was the mode, and
her long white arms were bare to the shoulders.</p>

<p>She had been curled up before the fire reading
when I entered, but she jumped up with an
expression of welcome upon her lips.</p>

<p>But not until her mother had bade me good-night
and discreetly withdrew, did she refer to the subject
which I knew obsessed her by night and by day.</p>

<p>"Well, Teddy," she asked, when I sat alone
with her upon the pale green silk-covered couch,
her little hand in mine, "Where have you been?
Why have you remained silent?"</p>

<p>"I've been in Brussels," I replied, and then,
quite frankly, I explained my quest after the
impostor.</p>

<p>She sat looking straight before her, her eyes
fixed like a person, in a dream. At last she spoke:</p>

<p>"I thought," she said in a strained voice, "that
you would have shown greater respect for me than
to do that&mdash;when you knew it would place you in
such great peril!"</p>

<p>"I have acted in your own interests, dearest,"
I replied, placing my arm tenderly about her neck.
"Ah! in what manner you will never know."</p>

<p>"My interests!" she echoed, in despair. "Have
I not told you that on the day Digby Kemsley
is arrested I intend to end my life," and as she
drew a long breath, I saw in her eyes that haunted,
terrified look which told me that she was
driven to desperation.</p>

<p>"No, no," I urged, stroking her hair with tenderness.
"I know all that you must suffer, Phrida,
but I am your friend and your protector. I will
never rest until I get at the truth."</p>

<p>"Ah! Revelation of the truth will, alas! prove
my undoing!" she whispered, in a voice full of fear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
"You don't know, dear, how your relentless chase
of that man is placing me in danger."</p>

<p>"But he is an adventurer, an impostor&mdash;a fugitive
from justice, and he merits punishment!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Ah! And if you say that," she cried, wildly
starting to her feet. "So do I! So do I!"</p>

<p>"Come, calm yourself, dearest," I said, placing
my hand upon her shoulder and forcing her back
into her chair. "You are upset to-night," and I
kissed her cold, white lips. "May I ring for
Mallock? Wouldn't you like to go to your
room?"</p>

<p>She drew a deep sigh, and with an effort repressed
the tears welling in her deep-set, haunted eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she faltered in her emotion. "Perhaps
I had better. I&mdash;I cannot bear this strain much
longer. You told me that the police did not suspect
me, but&mdash;but, now I know they do. A man has
been watching outside the house all day for two
days past. Yes," she sobbed, "they will come,
come to arrest me, but they will only find that&mdash;that
I've cheated them!"</p>

<p>"They will not come," I answered her. "I
happen to know more than I can tell you, Phrida,"
I whispered. "You need have no fear of
arrest."</p>

<p>"But that woman Petre! She may denounce
me&mdash;she will, I know!"</p>

<p>"They take no notice of such allegations at
Scotland Yard. They receive too much wild
correspondence," I declared. "No, dearest, go to
bed and rest&mdash;rest quite assured that at present
you are in no peril, and, further, that every hour
which elapses brings us nearer a solution of the
tragic and tantalising problem. May I ring for
Mallock?" I asked, again kissing her passionately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
upon those lips, hard and cold as marble, my
heart full of sympathy for her in her tragic
despair.</p>

<p>"Yes," she responded faintly in a voice so low that
I could hardly catch it. So I crossed and rang
the bell for her maid.</p>

<p>Then, when she had kissed me good-night, looking
into my eyes with a strange expression of wistfulness,
and left the room, I dashed across to
that little table whereon the ivory-hilted knife was
lying and seized the important piece of evidence,
so that it might not fall into Edwards' hands.</p>

<p>I held it within my fingers, and taking it across
to the fireplace, examined it in the strong light.
The ivory was yellow and old, carved with the
escutcheon bearing the three balls, the arms of the
great House of Medici. The blade, about seven
inches long, was keen, triangular, and, at the point,
sharp as a needle. Into it the rust of centuries had
eaten, though in parts it was quite bright, evidently
due to recent cleaning.</p>

<p>I was examining it for any stains that might be
upon it&mdash;stains of the life-blood of Marie Bracq.
But I could find none. No. They had been
carefully removed, yet chemical analysis would,
without doubt, reveal inevitable traces of the
ghastly truth.</p>

<p>I had my back to the door, and was still holding
the deadly weapon in my hand, scrutinising it
closely, when I heard a slight movement behind
me, and turning, confronted Phrida, standing erect
and rigid, like a statue.</p>

<p>Her face was white as death, her thin hands
clenched, her haunted eyes fixed upon me.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see!" she cried hoarsely. "You know&mdash;eh?
You <i>know</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I do not <i>know</i>, Phrida," was my deep
reply, as I snatched her hand and held it in my
own. "I only surmise that this knife was used
on that fatal night, because of the unusual shape
of its blade&mdash;because of the medical evidence that
by such a knife Marie Bracq was killed."</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"And you are taking it as evidence&mdash;against
me!"</p>

<p>"Evidence against you, darling!" I echoed in
reproach. "Do you think that I, the man who
loves you, is endeavouring to convict you of a
crime? No. Leave matters to me. I am your
friend&mdash;not your enemy!"</p>

<p>A silence fell between us. She neither answered
nor did she move for some moments. Then she
said in a deep wistful tone:</p>

<p>"Ah! if I could only believe that you are!"</p>

<p>"But I am," I declared vehemently. "I love you,
Phrida, with all my soul, and I will never believe ill
of you&mdash;never, never!"</p>

<p>"How can you do otherwise in these terrible
circumstances?" she queried, with a strange contraction
of her brows.</p>

<p>"I love you, and because I love you so dearly&mdash;because
you are all the world to me," I said, pressing
her to my heart, "I will never accept what an
enemy may allege&mdash;never, until you are permitted
to relate your own story."</p>

<p>I still held the weapon in my hand, and I saw that
her eyes wandered to it.</p>

<p>"Ah! Teddy!" she cried, with sudden emotion.
"How can I thank you sufficiently for those words?
Take that horrible thing and hide it&mdash;hide it anywhere
from my eyes, for sight of it brings all the
past back to me. Yet&mdash;yet I was afraid," she went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
on, "I dare not hide it, lest any one should ask what
had become of it, and thus suspicions might be
aroused. Ah! every time I have come into this
room it has haunted me&mdash;I seem to see that terrible
scene before my eyes&mdash;how&mdash;how they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she broke off short, and covering her face
with both hands added, after a few seconds'
silence:</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, take it away&mdash;never let me gaze
upon it again. But I beg of you, dear, to&mdash;to
preserve my secret&mdash;my terrible secret!"</p>

<p>And she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Not a single word shall pass my lips, neither
shall a single soul see this knife. I will take it
and cast it away&mdash;better to the bottom of the
Thames. To-night it shall be in a place where it
can never be found. So go to your room, and rest
assured that you, darling, have at least one friend&mdash;myself."</p>

<p>I felt her breast heave and fall as I held her in
my strong embrace.</p>

<p>Then without words she raised her white, tear-stained
face and kissed me long and fondly; afterwards
she left me, and in silence tottered from the
room, closing the door after her.</p>

<p>I still held the knife in my hand&mdash;the weapon
by which the terrible deed had been perpetrated.</p>

<p>What could I think? What would you, my
reader, have thought if the woman you love stood in
the same position as Phrida Shand&mdash;which God
forbid?</p>

<p>I stood reflecting, gazing upon the antique poignard.
Then slowly and deliberately I made up
my mind, and placing the unsheathed knife in
my breast pocket I went out into the hall, put
on my coat and hat, and left the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Half an hour later I halted casually upon Westminster
Bridge, and when no one was near, cast
the ancient "Misericordia" into the dark
flowing waters of the river, knowing that Edwards
and his inquisitive assistants could never recover
it as evidence against my love.</p>

<p>Four days later I received a letter from Fr&eacute;my,
dated from the Hotel National at Strasbourg,
stating that he had traced the fugitives from Munich
to the latter city, but there he had lost all trace of
them. He believed they had gone to Paris, and
with his chief's permission he was leaving for the
French capital that night.</p>

<p>Weeks passed&mdash;weeks of terror and apprehension
for my love, and of keenest anxiety for myself.</p>

<p>The month of May went by, spring with all her
beauties appeared in the parks and faded in the
heat and dust, while the London season commenced.
Men who were otherwise never seen in town, strolled
up and down St. James's Street and Piccadilly,
smart women rode in the Row in the morning and
gave parties at night, while the usual crop of charitable
functions, society scandals, Parliamentary
debates, and puff-paragraphs in the papers about
Lady Nobody's dances showed the gay world
of London to be in full swing.</p>

<p>My mantelshelf was well decorated with cards
of invitation, for, nowadays, the bachelor in London
can have a really good time if he chooses, yet I
accepted few, spending most of my days immersed
in business&mdash;in order to occupy my thoughts&mdash;while
my evenings I spent at Cromwell Road.</p>

<p>For weeks Phrida had not referred to the tragedy
in any way, and I had been extremely careful to
avoid the subject. Yet, from her pale, drawn countenance&mdash;so
unlike her former self&mdash;I knew how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
recollection of it ever haunted her, and what dread
terror had gripped her young heart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shand, ignorant of the truth, had many
times expressed to me confidentially, fear that her
daughter was falling into a bad state of health;
and, against Phrida's wishes, had called in the
family doctor, who, likewise ignorant, had ordered
her abroad.</p>

<p>"Get her out of the dullness of this road, Mrs.
Shand," he had said. "She wants change and
excitement. Take her to some gay place on the
Continent&mdash;Dinard, Trouville, Aix-les-Bains, Ostend&mdash;some
place where there is brightness and
movement. A few weeks there will effect a great
change in her, I'm certain."</p>

<p>But Phrida refused to leave London, though I
begged her to follow the doctor's advice, and even
offered to accompany them.</p>

<p>As far as I could gather, Van Huffel, in Brussels,
had given up the search for the fugitives; though,
the more I reflected upon his replies to my questions
as to the real identity of Marie Bracq, the
more remarkable they seemed.</p>

<p>Who was she? That was the great problem
uppermost always in my mind. Phrida had declared
that she only knew her by that name&mdash;that
she knew nothing further concerning
her. And so frankly had she said this, that I
believed her.</p>

<p>Yet I argued that, if the death of Marie Bracq
was of such serious moment as the <i>Chef du Suret&eacute;</i>
had declared, then he surely would not allow the
inquiry to drop without making the most strenuous
efforts to arrest those suspected of the crime.</p>

<p>But were his suspicions, too, directed towards
Phrida? Had he, I wondered, been in consultation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
with Edwards, and had the latter, in confidence,
revealed to him his own theory?</p>

<p>I held my breath each time that idea crossed
my mind&mdash;as it did so very often.</p>

<p>From Fr&eacute;my I had had several letters dated from
the Pr&eacute;fecture of Police, Brussels, but the tenor
of all was the same&mdash;nothing to report.</p>

<p>One thing gratified me. Edwards had not approached
my love, although I knew full well, just
as Phrida did, that day after day observation was
being kept upon the house in Cromwell Road, yet
perhaps only because the detective's duty demanded
it. At least I tried to think so.</p>

<p>Still the one fact remained that, after all our
efforts&mdash;the efforts of Scotland Yard, of the Belgian
police, and of my own eager inquiries&mdash;a solution of
the problem was as far off as ever.</p>

<p>Somewhere there existed a secret&mdash;a secret that,
as Phrida had declared to me, was inviolable.</p>

<p>Would it ever be revealed? Would the ghastly
truth ever be laid bare?</p>

<p>The affair of Harrington Gardens was indeed a
mystery of London&mdash;as absolute and perfect an
enigma of crime as had ever been placed before that
committee of experts at Scotland Yard&mdash;the Council
of Seven.</p>

<p>Even they had failed to find a solution! How,
then, could I ever hope to be successful?</p>

<p>When I thought of it, I paced my lonely room
in a frenzy of despair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>THE SELLER OF SHAWLS.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">After</span> much eloquent persuasion on my part, and
much straight talking on the part of the spectacled
family doctor, and of Mrs. Shand, Phrida at last,
towards the last days of June, allowed us to take
her to Dinard, where, at the Hotel Royal, we spent
three pleasant weeks, making many automobile
excursions to Trouville, to Dinan, and other places
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The season had scarcely commenced, nevertheless
the weather was perfect, and gradually I had the
satisfaction of seeing the colour return to the soft
cheeks of my well-beloved.</p>

<p>Before leaving London I had, of course, seen
Edwards, and, knowing that watch was being kept
upon her, I accepted the responsibility of reporting
daily upon my love's movements, she being still
under suspicion.</p>

<p>"I ought not to do this, Mr. Royle," he had
said, "but the circumstances are so unusual that I
feel I may stretch a point in the young lady's favour
without neglecting my duty. And after all," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
added, "we have no direct evidence&mdash;at least not
sufficient to justify an arrest."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't that woman Petre come forward
and boldly make her statement personally?" I
had queried.</p>

<p>"Well, she may know that you are still alive"&mdash;he
laughed&mdash;"and if so&mdash;she's afraid to go further."</p>

<p>I questioned him regarding his inquiries concerning
the actual identity of Marie Bracq, but he only
raised his eyebrows and replied:</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Royle, I know nothing more than
you do. They no doubt possess some information
in Brussels, but they are careful to keep it there."</p>

<p>And so I had accompanied Phrida and her mother,
hoping that the change of air and scenery might
cause her to forget the shadow of guilt which now
seemed to rest upon her and to crush all life and
hope from her young heart.</p>

<p>Tiring of Dinard, Mrs. Shand hired a big, grey
touring-car, and together we went first through
Brittany, then to Vannes, Nantes, and up to Tours,
afterwards visiting the famous chateaux of Touraine,
Amboise Loches, and the rest, the weather being
warm and delightful, and the journey one of the
pleasantest and most picturesque in Europe.</p>

<p>When July came, Phrida appeared greatly improved
in both health and spirits. Yet was it only
pretence? Did she in the lonely watches of the night
still suffer that mental torture which I knew, alas!
she had suffered, for her own deep-set eyes, and pale,
sunken cheeks had revealed to me the truth. Each
time I sat down and wrote that confidential note
to Edwards, I hated myself&mdash;that I was set to
spy upon the woman I loved with all my heart
and soul.</p>

<p>Would the truth never be told? Would the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
mystery of that tragic January night in South
Kensington never be elucidated?</p>

<p>One evening in the busy but pleasant town of
Tours, Mrs. Shand having complained of headache
after a long, all-day excursion in the car, Phrida
and I sauntered out after dinner, and after a brief
walk sat down outside one of those big caf&eacute;s where
the tables are placed out beneath the leafy chestnut
trees of the boulevard.</p>

<p>The night was hot and stifling, and as we sat
there chatting over our coffee amid a crowd of
people enjoying the air after the heat of the day,
a dark-faced, narrow-eyed Oriental in a fez, with a
number of Oriental rugs and cheap shawls, came and
stood before us, in the manner of those itinerant
vendors who haunt Continental caf&eacute;s.</p>

<p>He said nothing, but, standing like a bronze
statue, he looked hard at me and pointed solemnly
at a quantity of lace which he held in his left hand.</p>

<p>"No, I want nothing," I replied in French,
shaking my head.</p>

<p>"Ve-ry cheep, sare!" he exclaimed in broken
English at last. "You no buy for laidee?" and
he showed his white teeth with a pleasant grin.</p>

<p>I again replied in the negative, perhaps a little
impatiently, when suddenly Phrida whispered to me:</p>

<p>"Why, we saw this same man in Dinard, and in
another place&mdash;I forget where. He haunts us!"</p>

<p>"These men go from town to town," I explained.
"They make a complete round of France."</p>

<p>Then I suddenly recollected that the man's face
was familiar. I had seen him outside the Piccadilly
Tube Station on the night of my tryst with
Mrs. Petre!</p>

<p>"Yes, laidee!" exclaimed the man, who had overheard
Phrida's words. "I see you Dinard&mdash;Hotel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Royal&mdash;eh?" he said with a smile. "Will you
buy my lace&mdash;seelk lace; ve-ry cheep?"</p>

<p>"I know it's cheap," I laughed; "but we don't
want it."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he placed it upon the little marble-topped
table for our inspection, and then bending,
he whispered into my ear a question:</p>

<p>"Mee-ster Royle you&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, starting.</p>

<p>"I want see you, to-night, alone. Say no-ting to
laidee till I see you&mdash;outside your hotel eleven
o'clock, sare&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>I sat staring at him in blank surprise, but in a
low voice I consented.</p>

<p>Then, very cleverly he asked in his normal voice,
looking at me with his narrow eyes, with dark
brows meeting:</p>

<p>"You no buy at that price&mdash;eh? Ah!" and he
sighed as he gathered up his wares: "Cheep, laidee&mdash;very
goot and cheep!"</p>

<p>And bowing, he slung them upon the heavy pile
already on his shoulder and stalked away.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" Phrida asked when he
had gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, only wanted me to buy the lot for five
francs!" I replied, for he had enjoined secrecy, and
I knew not but he might be an emissary of Fr&eacute;my
or of Edwards. Therefore I deemed it best for the
time to evade her question.</p>

<p>Still, both excited and puzzled, I eagerly kept
the appointment.</p>

<p>When I emerged from the hotel on the stroke of
eleven I saw the man without his pile of merchandise
standing in the shadow beneath a tree, on the
opposite side of the boulevard, awaiting me.</p>

<p>Quickly I crossed to him, and asked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what do you want with me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mee-ster Royle! I have watched you and the
young laidee a long time. You travel so quickly,
and I go by train from town to town&mdash;slowly."</p>

<p>"Yes, but why?" I asked, as we strolled
together under the trees.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you some-zing, mee-ster. I no
Arabe&mdash;I Senos, from Huacho."</p>

<p>"From Huacho!" I gasped quickly.</p>

<p>"Yees. My dead master he English&mdash;Sir Digby
Kemsley!"</p>

<p>"Sir Digby!" I cried. "And you were his
servant. You knew this man Cane&mdash;why, you were
the man who heard your master curse the man
who placed the deadly reptile against his face. You
made a statement to the police, did you not?" I
asked frantically.</p>

<p>"Yees, Mee-ster Royle&mdash;I did! I know a lot,"
he replied in his slow way, stalking along in the
short breeches, red velvet jacket, and fez of an
Oriental.</p>

<p>"You will tell me, Senos?" I said. "You will
tell me everything?" I urged. "Tell me all that
you know!"</p>

<p>He grinned in triumph, saying:</p>

<p>"I know a lot&mdash;I know all. Cane killed my
master&mdash;killed him with the snake&mdash;he and Luis
together. I know&mdash;I saw. But the Englishman is
always great, and his word believed by the commissary
of police&mdash;not the word of Senos. Oh, no! but
I have followed; I have watched. I have been
beside Cane night and day when he never dream I
was near. I tell the young lady all the truth, and&mdash;ah!&mdash;she
tell him after I beg her to be silent."</p>

<p>"But where is Cane now?" I asked eagerly.
"Do you know?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"The 'Red' Englishman&mdash;he with Madame
Petre and Luis&mdash;he call himself Ali, the Indian."</p>

<p>"Where? Can you take me to them?" I asked.
"You know there is a warrant out for their arrest?"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" I cried.</p>

<p>"No, not yet. I wait," he laughed. "I know
every-ting. He kill my master; I kill him. My
master be very good master."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he was," I said.</p>

<p>"That man Cane&mdash;very bad man. Your poor
young laidee&mdash;ah? She not know me. I know
her. You no say you see me&mdash;eh? I tell every-ting
later. You go Ostend; I meet you. Then we see
them."</p>

<p>"At Ostend!" I cried. "Are they there?"</p>

<p>"You go Ostend to-morrow. Tell me your hotel.
Senos come&mdash;eh? Senos see them with you. Oh!
Oh!" he said in his quaint way, grinning from ear
to ear.</p>

<p>I looked at the curious figure beside me. He was
the actual man who had heard the dying cries of
Sir Digby Kemsley.</p>

<p>"But, tell me," I urged, "have you been in
London? Do you know that a young lady died in
Cane's apartment&mdash;was killed there?"</p>

<p>"Senos knows," he laughed grimly. "Senos has
not left him&mdash;ah, no! He kill my master. I never
leave him till I crush him&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Then you know, of what occurred at Harrington
Gardens?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, Senos know. He tell in Ostend when we
meet," he replied. "You go to-morrow, eh?" and
he looked at me anxiously with those dark, rather
blood-shot eyes of his.</p>

<p>"I will go to-morrow," I answered without hesita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>tion;
and, taking out my wallet I gave him three
notes of a hundred francs each, saying:</p>

<p>"This will pay your fare. I will go straight to
the Grand Hotel, on the Digue. You will meet me
there."</p>

<p>"And the laidee&mdash;eh? She must be there too."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Shand will be with me," I said.</p>

<p>"Good, sare&mdash;very good!" he replied, thrusting
the notes into the inner pocket of his red velvet
jacket. "I get other clothes&mdash;these only to sell
things," and he smiled.</p>

<p>I tried to induce him to tell me more, but he
refused, saying:</p>

<p>"At Ostend Senos show you. He tell you all
he know&mdash;he tell the truth about the 'Red'
Englishman."</p>

<p>And presently, after he had refused the drink I
offered him, the Peruvian, who was earning his
living as an Arab of North Africa, bowed with
politeness and left me, saying:</p>

<p>"I meet you, Mee-ster Royle, at Grand Hotel in
Ostend. But be careful neither of you seen. They
are sharp, clever, alert&mdash;oh, ve-ry! We leave
to-morrow&mdash;eh? Good!"</p>

<p>And a moment later the quaint figure was lost in
the darkness.</p>

<p>An hour later, though past midnight, I despatched
two long telegrams&mdash;one to Fr&eacute;my in Brussels, and
the other to Edwards in London.</p>

<p>Then, two days later, by dint of an excuse that I
had urgent business in Ostend, I found myself with
Phrida and Mrs. Shand, duly installed, in rooms
overlooking the long, sunny Digue, one of the finest
sea-promenades in Europe.</p>

<p>Ostend had begun her season, the racing season
had commenced, and all the hotels had put on coats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
of new, white paint, and opened their doors, while
in the huge Kursaal they played childish games of
chance now that M. Marquet was no longer king&mdash;yet
the magnificent orchestra was worth a journey
to listen to.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of our arrival, all was gay and
bright; outside the blue sea, the crowd of well-dressed
promenaders, and the golden sands where
the bathing was so merry and so chic.</p>

<p>But I had no eyes for the beauties or gaiety
of the place. I sat closeted in my room with two
friends, Fr&eacute;my and Edwards, whom I introduced
and who quickly fraternised.</p>

<p>A long explanatory letter I had written to Brussels
had reached Fr&eacute;my before his departure from the
capital.</p>

<p>"Excellent," he was saying, his round, clean-shaven
face beaming. "This Peruvian evidently
knows where they are, and like all natives,
wants to make a <i>coup-de-theatre</i>. I've brought
two reliable men with me from Brussels, and we
ought&mdash;if they are really here&mdash;to make a good
capture."</p>

<p>"Miss Shand knows nothing, you say?" Edwards
remarked, seated on the edge of my bed.</p>

<p>"No. This man Senos was very decided upon
the point."</p>

<p>"He has reasons, no doubt," remarked the
detective.</p>

<p>"It is just four o'clock," I remarked. "He has
given me a rendezvous at the Caf&eacute; de la R&egrave;gence,
a little place at the corner of the Place d'Armes. I
went round to find it as soon as I arrived. We're
due there in a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Then let us go, messieurs," Fr&eacute;my suggested.</p>

<p>"And what about Miss Shand?" I asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>The two detectives held a brief discussion. Then
Edwards, addressing me, said:</p>

<p>"I really think that she ought to be present, Mr.
Royle. Would you bring her? Prepare her for
a scene&mdash;as there no doubt will be&mdash;and then
follow us."</p>

<p>"But Senos will not speak without I am present,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Then go along to Miss Shand, give her my
official compliments and ask her to accompany
us upon our expedition," he replied.</p>

<p>And upon his suggestion I at once acted.</p>

<p>Truly those moments were breathless and exciting.
I could hear my own heart beat as I went along the
hotel corridor to knock at the door of her room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>FACE TO FACE.</h3>


<p class="gap2"><span class="smcap">We</span> had, all four of us, ranged ourselves up under
the wall of a big white house in the Chausee de
Nieuport, which formed the south side of the racecourse,
and where, between us and the sea, rose
the colossal Royal Palace Hotel, when Fr&eacute;my
advanced to the big varnished oak door, built
wide for the entrance of automobiles, and rang
the electric bell.</p>

<p>In response there came out a sedate, white-whiskered
man-servant in black coat and striped
yellow waistcoat, the novel Belgium livery, but
in an instant he was pinioned by the two detectives
from Brussels, and the way opened for us.</p>

<p>"No harm, old one!" cried the detectives in
French, after the man had admitted his master was
at home. "We are police-agents, and doing our
duty. We don't want you, only we don't intend
you to cry out, that's all. Keep a still tongue, old
one, and you're all right!" they laughed as they
kept grip of him. The Continental detective is
always humorous in the exercise of his duty.
I once witnessed in Italy a man arrested for murder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
He had on a thin light suit, and having been to bed
in it, the back was terribly pleated and creased.
"Hulloa!" cried the detective, "so it is you.
Come along, old dried fig!" I was compelled to
laugh, for the culprit's thin, brown coat had all the
creases of a Christmas fig.</p>

<p>The house we rushed in was a big, luxurious one,
with a wide passage running through to the Garage,
and on the left a big, wide marble staircase with
windows of stained glass and statues of dancing
girls of the art nouveau.</p>

<p>Fr&eacute;my, leaving his assistants below with the
man-servant, and crying to Edwards to look out
for anybody trying to escape, sprang up the marble
steps three at a time, followed by the narrow-eyed
Peruvian, while Phrida, clinging to my arm, held
her breath in quick apprehension. She was full of
fear and amazement.</p>

<p>I had had much difficulty in persuading her to
accompany us, for she seemed in terror of denunciation.
Indeed, not until I told her that Edwards had
demanded her presence, had she consented.</p>

<p>On the first landing, a big, thick-carpeted place
with a number of long, white doors leading into
various apartments, Fr&eacute;my halted and raised his
finger in silence to us.</p>

<p>He stood glancing from door to door, wondering
which to enter.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he stood and gave a yell as though
of fearful pain.</p>

<p>In an instant there was a quick movement in a
room on the right, the door opened and the woman
Petre came forth in alarm.</p>

<p>Next second, however, finding herself face to face
with me, she halted upon the threshold and fell back
against the lintel of the door while we rushed in to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
encounter the man I had known as Digby, standing
defiant, with arms folded and brows knit.</p>

<p>"Well," he demanded of me angrily. "What
do you want here?"</p>

<p>"I've brought a friend of yours to see you, Mr.
Cane," I said quietly, and Edwards stepped aside
from the door to admit the Peruvian Senos.</p>

<p>The effect was instant and indeed dramatic. His
face fell, his eyes glared, his teeth set, and his
nails dug themselves into his palms.</p>

<p>"Mee-ster Cane," laughed the dark-faced native,
in triumph. "You no like see Senos&mdash;eh? No, no.
He know too much&mdash;eh? He watch you always
after he see you with laidee in Marseilles&mdash;he see you
in London&mdash;ha! ha! Senos know every-ting. You
kill my master, and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" cried the man accused. "This
fellow made the same statement at Huacho, and it
was disproved."</p>

<p>"Then you admit you are not Sir Digby Kemsley?"
exclaimed Edwards quickly. "You are Herbert
Cane, and I have a warrant for your arrest for
murder."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he laughed with an air of forced gaiety.
"That is amusing!"</p>

<p>"I'm very glad you think so, my dear sir,"
remarked the detective, glancing round to where
the woman Petre had been placed in an armchair
quite unconscious.</p>

<p>Phrida was clinging to my arm, but uttered no
word. I felt her fingers trembling as she gripped me.</p>

<p>"I suppose you believe this native&mdash;eh?" asked
the accused with sarcasm. "He tried to blackmail
me in Peru, and because I refused to be bled he
made a statement that I had killed my friend."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the native. "Senos knows&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
see with his own eyes. He see Luis and you
with snake in a box. Luis could charm snakes by
music. Senos watch you both that night!"</p>

<p>"Oh! tell what infernal lies you like," cried Cane
in angry disgust.</p>

<p>"You, the 'Red' Englishman, are well known in
Peru, and so is your friend&mdash;the woman there, who
help you in all your bad schemes," said Senos,
indicating the inanimate form of Mrs. Petre. "You
introduced her to my master, but he no like her&mdash;he
snub her&mdash;so you send her to Lima to wait for
you&mdash;till you kill him, and get the paper&mdash;eh?
I saw you steal paper&mdash;big blue paper with
big seals&mdash;from master's despatch-box after snake
bite him."</p>

<p>"Paper!" echoed Edwards. "What paper?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can explain something," Fr&eacute;my
interrupted in French. "I learnt some strange
facts only three days ago which throw a great deal
of light on this case."</p>

<p>"I don't want to listen to all these romances,"
laughed Cane defiantly. He was an astute and
polished adventurer, one of the cleverest and most
elusive in Europe, and he had all the adventurer's
nonchalance and impudence. At this moment he
was living in that fine house he had taken furnished
for the summer and passing as Mr. Charles K.
Munday, banker, of Chicago. Certainly he had so
altered his personal appearance that at first I
scarcely recognised him as the elegant, refined man
whom I had so foolishly trusted as a friend.</p>

<p>"But now you are under arrest, mon cher ami,
you will be compelled to listen to a good many
unpleasant reminders," Fr&eacute;my remarked with a
broad grin of triumph upon his round, clean-shaven
face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you arrest me, then you must arrest that
woman there, Phrida Shand, for the murder of
Marie Bracq in my flat in London. She was jealous
of her&mdash;and killed her with a knife she brought
with her for the purpose," Cane said with a laugh.
"If I must suffer&mdash;then so must she! She killed
the girl. She can't deny it!"</p>

<p>"Phrida!" I gasped, turning to my love, who
still clung to me convulsively. "You hear what this
man says&mdash;this vile charge he brings against you&mdash;a
charge of murder! Say that it is not the truth,"
I implored. "Tell me that he lies!"</p>

<p>Her big eyes were fixed upon mine, her countenance
blanched to the lips, and her breath came and went
in short, quick gasps.</p>

<p>At last her lips moved, as we all gazed at her.
Her voice was only a hoarse, broken whisper.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't!" she replied, and fell back into my
arms in a swoon.</p>

<p>"You see!" laughed the accused man. "You,
Royle, are so clever that you only bring grief and
disaster upon yourself. I prevented Mrs. Petre
from telling the truth because I thought you had
decided to drop the affair."</p>

<p>"What?" I cried. "When your accomplice&mdash;that
woman Petre&mdash;made a dastardly attempt upon
my life at your instigation, and left me for dead.
Drop the affair&mdash;never! You are an assassin, and
you shall suffer the penalty."</p>

<p>"And so will Phrida Shand. She deceived you
finely&mdash;eh? I admire her cleverness," he laughed
"She was a thorough Sport, she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" commanded Edwards roughly. "I
give you into the custody of Inspector Fr&eacute;my, of
the Belgian Suret&eacute;, on a charge of murder committed
within the Republic of Peru."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I also arrest the prisoner," added Fr&eacute;my,
"for offences committed in London and within the
Grand Duchy of Luxemburg."</p>

<p>The man, pale and haggard-eyed notwithstanding
his bravado, started visibly at the famous detective's
words, while at that moment the two men from
Brussels appeared in the room, having released the
white-whiskered man-servant, who stood aghast and
astounded on the threshold. I supported my
love, now quite unconscious, in my strong arms,
and was trying to restore her, in which I was
immediately aided by one of the detectives.</p>

<p>The scene was an intensely dramatic one&mdash;truly
an unusual scene to take place in the house of the
sedate old Baron Terwindt, ancient Ministre de la
Justice of Belgium.</p>

<p>I was bending over my love and dashing water
into her face when we were all suddenly startled
by a loud explosion, and then we saw in Cane's
hand a smoking revolver.</p>

<p>He had fired at me&mdash;and, fortunately, missed
me.</p>

<p>In a second, however, the officers fell upon him,
and after a brief but desperate struggle, in which
a table and chairs were overturned, the weapon was
wrenched from his grasp.</p>

<p>"Eh! bien," exclaimed Fr&eacute;my, when the
weapon had been secured from the accused. "As
you will have some unpleasant things to hear, you
may as well listen to some of them now. You
have denied your guilt. Well, I will tell Inspector
Edwards what I have discovered concerning you
and your cunning and dastardly treatment of the
girl known as Marie Bracq."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear, I tell you!" he shouted
in English. "If I'm arrested, take me away, put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
me into prison and send me over to England, where
I shall get a fair trial."</p>

<p>"But you shall hear," replied the big-faced
official. "There is plenty of time to take you to
Brussels, you know. Listen. The man Senos has
alleged that you stole from the man you murdered
a blue paper&mdash;bearing a number of seals. He is
perfectly right. You sold that paper on the eighth
of January last for a quarter of a million francs.
Ah! my dear friend, you cannot deny that. The
purchaser will give evidence&mdash;and what then?"</p>

<p>Cane stood silent. His teeth were set, his gaze
fixed, his grey brows contracted.</p>

<p>The game was up, and he knew it. Yet his
marvellously active mind was already seeking a way
out. He was amazingly resourceful, as later on
was shown, when the details of his astounding
career came to be revealed.</p>

<p>"Now the true facts are these&mdash;and perhaps
mademoiselle and the man Senos will be able to
supplement them&mdash;his Highness the Grand Duke
of Luxemburg, about two years ago, granted to an
American named Cassell a valuable concession for
a strategic railway to run across his country from
Echternach, on the eastern, or German, frontier of the
Grand Duchy, to Arlon on the Belgian frontier, the
Government of the latter State agreeing at the same
time to continue the line direct to Sedan, and thus
create a main route from Coblenz, on the Rhine, to
Paris&mdash;a line which Germany had long wanted for
military purposes, as it would be of incalculable
value in the event of further hostilities with France.
This concession, for which the American paid to the
Grand Duke a considerable sum, was afterwards purchased
by Sir Digby Kemsley&mdash;with his Highness's
full sanction, he knowing him to be a great English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
railroad engineer. Meanwhile, as time went on, the
Grand Duke was approached by the French Government
with a view to rescinding the concession, as it
was realised what superiority such a line would give
Germany in the event of the massing of her troops
in Eastern France. At first the Grand Duke refused
to listen, but both Russia and Austria presented
their protests, and his Highness found himself in
a dilemma. All this was known to you, m'sieur
Cane, through one Ludwig Mayer, a German secret
agent, who inadvertently spoke about it while you
were on a brief visit to Paris. You then resolved to
return at once to Peru, make the acquaintance of
Sir Digby Kemsley, and obtain the concession.
You went, you were fortunate, inasmuch as he was
injured and helpless, and you deliberately killed
him, and securing the document, sailed for Europe,
assuming the identity of the actual purchaser of
the concession. Oh, yes!" he laughed, "you
were exceedingly cunning and clever, for you did
not at once deal with it. No, you went to Luxemburg.
You made certain observations and inquiries.
You stayed at the Hotel Brasseur for a week, and
then, you were afraid to approach the Grand Duke
with an offer to sell back the stolen concession, but&mdash;well,
by that time you had resolved upon a very
pretty and romantic plan of action," and he paused
for a moment and gazed around at us.</p>

<p>"Then robbery was the motive of the crime in
Peru!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Fr&eacute;my replied. "But I will now
relate how I came into the inquiry. In the last
days of January, I was called in secret to Luxemburg
by the Grand Duke, who, when we sat alone together,
informed me that his only daughter Stephanie, aged
twenty-one, who was a rather erratic young lady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and fond of travelling incognito, had disappeared.
The last heard of her was three weeks before&mdash;in
Paris&mdash;where she had, on her return from Egypt, been
staying a couple of days at the Hotel Maurice with
her aunt, the Grand Duchess of Baden, but she had
packed her things and left, and nothing more had
been heard of her. Search in her room, however,
had revealed two letters, signed 'Phrida,' and
addressed to a certain Marie Bracq."</p>

<p>"Why, I never wrote to her in my life!" my love
declared, for she had now regained her senses.</p>

<p>"His Highness further revealed to me the fact
that his daughter had, while in Egypt, made the
acquaintance at the Hotel Savoy on the Island of
Elephantine, of the great English railroad engineer,
Sir Digby Kemsley, who had purchased a railway
concession he had given, and which he was exceedingly
anxious to re-purchase and thus continue on
friendly terms with France. His daughter, on her
return to Luxemburg, and before going to Paris,
had mentioned her acquaintance with Sir Digby,
and that he held the concession. Therefore, through
her intermediary, Sir Digby&mdash;who was, of course,
none other than this assassin, Cane&mdash;went again
to Luxemburg and parted with the important
document for a quarter of a million francs. That
was on the eighth of January."</p>

<p>"After the affair at Harrington Gardens,"
Edwards remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes; after the murder of Marie Bracq, he lost no
time in disposing of the concession."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" cried the accused. "That girl
there killed her. I didn't&mdash;she was jealous of
her!"</p>

<p>My love shrank at the man's words, yet still
clinging to me, her beautiful countenance pale as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
death, her lips half parted, her eyes staring straight
in front of her.</p>

<p>"Phrida," I said in a low voice, full of sympathy,
"you hear what this man has alleged? Now that
the truth is being told, will you, too, not speak?
Speak!" I cried in my despair, "speak, dearest, I
beg of you!"</p>

<p>"No," she sighed. "You&mdash;you would turn from
me&mdash;you would hate me!"</p>

<p>And at her words Cane burst into a peal of harsh,
triumphant laughter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>SHOWS THE TRUTH-TELLER.</h3>


<p class="gap2">"<span class="smcap">Speak</span>, laidee," urged the Peruvian. "Speak&mdash;tell
truth. Senos know&mdash;he know!"</p>

<p>But my love was still obdurate.</p>

<p>"I prefer to face death," she whispered, "than to
reveal the bitter truth to you, dear."</p>

<p>What could I do? The others heard her words,
and Cane was full of triumph.</p>

<p>"I think, Miss Shand, that you should now tell
whatever you know of this complicated affair. The
truth will certainly have to be threshed out in a
criminal court."</p>

<p>But she made no answer, standing there,
swaying slightly, with her white face devoid of
expression.</p>

<p>"Let Senos tell you some-tings," urged the narrow-eyed
native. "When that man kill my master he
fly to Lisbon. There Mrs. Petre meet him and go
London. There he become Sir Digby Kemsley, and
I see him often, often, because I crossed as stoker
on same boat. He go to Luxemburg. I follow.
One day he see Grand Duke's daughter&mdash;pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
young laidee&mdash;and somebody tell him she go to
Egypt. She go, and he follow. I wait in Marseilles.
I sell my rugs, wait three, four weeks and meet each
steamer from Alexandria. At last he come with
three laidees, and go to the Louvre et Paix, where I
sell my rugs outside the caf&eacute;. I see he always with
her&mdash;walking, driving, laughing. I want to tell her
the truth&mdash;that the man is not my master, but his
assassin. Ah! but no opportunity. They go to
Paris. Then she and the laidees go to Luxemburg,
and he to London. I follow her, and stay in Luxemburg
to sell my shawls, and to see her. She drive
out of the palace every day. Once I try and speak
to her, but police arrest me and keep me prison two
days&mdash;ugh! After a week she with another laidee
go to Paris; then she alone go to Carlton Hotel in
London. I watch there and see Cane call on her.
He no see me&mdash;ah, no! I often watch him to his
home in Harrington Gardens; often see him with
that woman Petre, and once I saw Luis with them.
I have much patience till one day the young lady
leave the hotel herself and walk along Pall Mall. I
follow and stop her. She very afraid of dark man,
but I tell her no be afraid of Senos. Quick, in few
words, I tell her that her friend not my master, Sir
Digby&mdash;only the man who killed him. She dumbstruck.
Tells me I am a liar, she will not believe.
I repeat what I said, and she declares I will have to
prove what I say. I tell her I am ready, and she
askes me to meet her at same place and same time
to-morrow. She greatly excited, and we part.
Senos laughs, for he has saved young laidee&mdash;daughter
of a king&mdash;from that man."</p>

<p>"What? You actually told her Highness!"
cried Fr&eacute;my in surprise.</p>

<p>"I told her how my master had been killed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
that man&mdash;with the snake&mdash;and I warned her to
avoid him. But she hesitated to believe Senos,"
was the native's reply. "Of course, she not know
me. That was date six January. I remember it,
for that night, poor young laidee&mdash;she die. She
killed!"</p>

<p>"What?" Edwards cried, staring at the speaker.
"She was killed, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Fr&eacute;my interrupted, "Marie Bracq was
the name assumed by her Highness, the daughter of
the Grand Duke. She loved freedom from all the
trammels of court life, and as I have told you, went
about Europe with her maid as her companion,
travelling in different names. Mademoiselle Marie
Bracq was one that it seems she used, only we did
not discover this until after her death, and after
his Highness had paid the quarter of a million
francs to regain the concession he had granted&mdash;money
which, I believe, the French Government
really supplied from their secret service
fund."</p>

<p>"Then it was the daughter of the Grand Duke
who fell a victim in Cane's flat?" I gasped in utter
surprise at this latest revelation.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'sieur," replied Fr&eacute;my. "You will
recollect, when you told us at the Pr&eacute;fecture
of the name of the victim, how dumbfounded
we were."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I recollect!" I said. "I remember
how your chief point-blank refused to betray the
confidence reposed in him."</p>

<p>And to all this the assassin of Sir Digby Kemsley
listened without a word, save to point to my love,
and declare:</p>

<p>"There stands the woman who killed Marie
Bracq. Arrest her!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Phrida stood rigid, motionless as a statue.</p>

<p>"Yes," she exclaimed at last, with all her courage,
"I&mdash;I will speak. I&mdash;I'll tell you everything. I
will confess, for I cannot bear this longer. And yet,
dearest," she cried, turning her face to me and looking
straight into my eyes, "I love you, though I
now know that after I have spoken&mdash;after I have
told the truth&mdash;you will despise and hate me! Ah,
God alone knows how I have suffered! how I have
prayed for deliverance from this. But it cannot be.
I have sinned, I suppose, and I must bear just
punishment."</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>We all looked at her, though the woman
Petre was still lying in her chair unconscious,
and upon the assassin's lips was a grim
smile.</p>

<p>"You recollect," Phrida said, turning to me,
"you remember the day when you introduced that
man to me. Well, from that hour I knew no peace.
He wrote to me, asking me to meet him, as he had
something to tell me concerning my future. Well, I
foolishly met him one afternoon in Rumpelmeyer's,
in St. James's Street, when he told me that he had
purchased a very important German patent for the
manufacture of certain chemicals which would
revolutionise prices, and would bring upon your firm
inevitable ruin, as you pursued the old-fashioned
methods. But, being your friend, and respecting us
both, he had decided not to go further with the new
process, and though he had given a large sum of
money for it, he would, in our mutual interests, not
allow it to be developed. Naturally, in my innocence
I thanked him, and from that moment, professing
great friendliness towards you, we became friends.
Sometimes I met him at the houses of friends, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
he always impressed upon me the necessity of keeping
our acquaintance a secret."</p>

<p>And she paused, placing her hand upon her
heart as though to stay its throbbing.</p>

<p>"One afternoon," she resumed, "the day of the
tragedy, I received a telegram urging me to meet
him without fail at five o'clock at Rumpelmeyer's.
This I did, when he imparted to me a secret&mdash;that
you, dear, were in the habit of meeting, at his flat,
a foreign woman named Marie Bracq, daughter of
a hair-dresser in the Edgware Road; that you,
whom I loved, were infatuated with her, and&mdash;and
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The liar!" I cried.</p>

<p>"He told me many things which naturally
excited me, and which, loving you as I did, drove
me to madness. I refused at first to heed his
words, for somehow I mistrusted him&mdash;I know not
why! But he offered to give me proof. If I went
that night, or early in the morning, to Harrington
Gardens, I would find her there, and I might
question her. Imagine my state of mind after
what he had revealed to me. I promised I
would come there in secret, and I went home,
my mind full of the lies and suspicion which
he had, I now see, so cleverly suggested. I
didn't then know him to be an assassin, but, mistrusting
him as I did, I took for my own protection
the old knife from the table in the drawing-room,
and concealed it inside my blouse. At one
o'clock next morning I crept out of the house
noiselessly, and walked to Harrington Gardens,
where I opened the outer door with the latch-key
he had given me. On ascending to his flat I heard
voices&mdash;I heard your voice, dear&mdash;therefore I
descended into the dark and waited&mdash;waited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
until you came down the stairs and left. I
saw you, and I was mad&mdash;mad! Then I went
up, and he admitted me. The trap was
already laid for me. I crossed that threshold
to my doom!"</p>

<p>"How?" I asked in my despair. "Tell me all,
Phrida,&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>But at this point the Peruvian, Senos, interrupted,
saying:</p>

<p>"Let me speak, sare. I tell you," he cried
quickly.</p>

<p>"When I speak to the lady in Pall Mall I follow her.
She go that afternoon to Harrington Gardens, but
there see Mrs. Petre, whom she already know. Mrs.
Petre find her excited, and after questioning her,
induce her to tell her what I say&mdash;that Cane he kill
my master. Then Mrs. Petre say, Sir Digby away in
the country&mdash;not return to London&mdash;at Paddington&mdash;till
one o'clock in the morning. I listen to it all,
for Senos friend of the hall-porter&mdash;eh? So young
laidee she says she come late in the night&mdash;half-past
one or two o'clock&mdash;and ask himself the truth. But
Cane in his room all the time, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, Phrida?" I asked quickly. "Tell
us what happened on that night when you
entered."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Cane sarcastically, "Lie to them&mdash;they'll
believe you, of course!"</p>

<p>"When I entered that man took me into the
sitting-room, and I sat down. Naturally I was
very upset. Mrs. Petre, whom I had met before,
was there, and after he had told me many things
about your relations with the daughter of a hair-dresser&mdash;things
which maddened me&mdash;Mrs. Petre
admitted her from the adjoining room. I was mad
with jealousy, loving you as I did. What happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
between us I do not know. I&mdash;I only fear that&mdash;that
I took the knife from my breast and, in a
frenzy of madness&mdash;killed her!" And she covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" cried Cane. "I'm glad you have
the moral courage to admit it."</p>

<p>"But describe exactly what occurred&mdash;as far as
you know," Edwards said, pressing her.</p>

<p>"I know that I was in a frenzy of passion, and
hysterical, perhaps," she said at last. "I recollect
Mrs. Petre saying that I looked very unwell, and
fetching me some smelling-salts from the next room.
I smelt them, but the odour was faint and
strange, and a few moments later I&mdash;well, I knew
no more."</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;afterwards?" I asked very
gravely.</p>

<p>"When, later on I came to my senses," she said
in slow, hard tones, as though reflecting, "I found
the girl whom I believed to be my rival in your
affections lying on the ground. In her breast was
the knife. Ah, shall I ever forget that moment when
I realised what I had done! Cane was bending
over me, urging me to remain calm. He told me
that my rival was dead&mdash;that I had killed her and
that she would not further interfere with my future.
I&mdash;I saw him bend over the body, withdraw the
knife, and wipe it upon his handkerchief, while that
woman, his accomplice, looked on. Then he gave
me back the knife, which instinctively I concealed,
and bade me go quickly and noiselessly back home,
promising secrecy, and declaring that both he and
Mrs. Petre would say nothing&mdash;that my terrible
secret was safe in their hands. I believed them,
and I crept down the stairs out into the road, and
walked home to Cromwell Road. I replaced the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
knife in the drawing-room, and I believed them
until&mdash;until I knew that you guessed my secret!
Then came that woman's betrayal, and I knew that
my doom was sealed," she added, her chin sinking
upon her breast.</p>

<p>"You see," laughed Cane defiantly, "that the
girl admits her guilt. She was jealous of Marie
Bracq, and in a frenzy of passion struck her down.
Mrs. Petre was there and witnessed it. She will
describe it all to you, no doubt, when she
recovers."</p>

<p>"And what she will say is one big lie," declared
Senos, coming forward again. "We all know
Mrs. Petre," he laughed in his high-pitched voice;
"she is your tool&mdash;she and Luis. But he become
a snake-charmer and give exhibitions at music-halls.
He bit by one snake at Darlington, a month ago,
and die quick. Ah, yes! Senos know! Snake
bite him, because he brought snake and give him to
that man to bite my poor master."</p>

<p>"Why will Mrs. Petre tell lies, Senos?" demanded
Edwards who, with Fr&eacute;my, was listening with
the greatest interest and putting the threads
of the tangled skein together in their proper
sequence.</p>

<p>"Because I, Senos, was at Harrington Gardens
that night. I knew that the laidee I had spoken
to was going there, and I feared that some-ting might
happen, for Cane a desperate man when charged
with the truth."</p>

<p>"You were there!" I gasped. "What do you
know?"</p>

<p>"Well, this," said the narrow-eyed man who had
hunted down the assassin of his master. "I waited
outside the house&mdash;waited some hours&mdash;when about
eleven Cane he came down and unfastened the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and leave it a little open. I creep in, and soon
after you, Mr. Royle, you come in. I wait and see
you go upstairs. Then I creep up and get out of
the window on the landing and on to the roof,
where I see inside Cane's room&mdash;see all that goes on.
My friend, the hall-porter, he tell me this sometime
before, and I find the spot where, kneeling down, I
see between the blinds. I see you talk with him
and I see you go. Then I see Miss Shand&mdash;she come
in and Mrs. Petre, and Cane talk to her. She very
excited when she meet young laidee, and Mrs. Petre
she give her bottle to smell. Then she faint off. The
laidee, daughter of great Duke, she say something
to Cane. He furious. She repeat what I say to her.
Then Mrs. Petre, who had given Miss Shand the
smelling-salts, find knife in her breast and secretly
puts it into Cane's hand. In a moment Cane
strikes the young lady with it&mdash;ah! full in the chest&mdash;and
she sinks on the floor&mdash;dead! It went into
her heart. Cane and the woman Petre talk
in low whispers for few minutes, both very
afraid. Then Miss Shand she wakes, opens her
eyes, and sees the young laidee dead on the
floor. She scream, but Mrs. Petre puts her
hand over her mouth. Cane take out the knife,
wipe it, and after telling her something, Miss
Shand creep away. Oh, yes, Senos he see it all!
Miss Shand quite innocent&mdash;she do nothing. Cane
kill daughter of the great Duke&mdash;he with his own
hand&mdash;he kill her. Senos saw him&mdash;with his
own eyes!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" I cried, rushing towards the native, and
gripping both his brown hands. "Thank you, Senos,
for those words. You have saved the woman I love,
for you are an eye-witness to that man's crime which
with such subtle ingenuity he has endeavoured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
to fasten upon her, and would have succeeded
had it not been for your dogged perseverance and
astuteness."</p>

<p>"He kill my master," replied the Peruvian
simply. "I watch him and convict him. He bad
assassin, gentlemens&mdash;very bad man!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>IS THE CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p class="gap2">"<span class="smcap">Do</span> you really believe that man?" asked Cane,
turning to us quite coolly, a sarcastic smile upon
his lips.</p>

<p>He was a marvellous actor, for he now betrayed
not the slightest confusion. He even laughed at the
allegations made against him. His bold defiance
utterly amazed us. Yet we knew now how resourceful
and how utterly unscrupulous he was.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" was the officer's reply. "You
murdered her Highness, fearing that she should go
to her father and expose you before you could have
time to dispose of your stolen concession to him.
Had she gone to him, the police would hunt you
down as Sir Digby's assassin. But by closing her
lips you hoped to be able to sell back the concession
and still preserve your guilty secret."</p>

<p>"Of course," remarked Fr&eacute;my, "the whole affair
is now quite plain. Poor Miss Shand was drawn
into the net in order to become this scoundrel's
victim. He intended from the first to make use of
her in some way, and did so at last by making her
believe she had killed her alleged rival in Mr. Royle's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
affection. Truly this man is a clever and unscrupulous
scoundrel, for he succeeded in obtaining a
quarter of a million francs from a reigning sovereign
for a document, to obtain which he had committed
a foul and dastardly crime!"</p>

<p>"A lie&mdash;lies, all of it!" shouted the accused
angrily, his face as white as paper.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not trouble," laughed Fr&eacute;my, speaking
in French. "You will have an opportunity to make
your defence before the judge&mdash;you and your
ingenious accomplice, Mrs. Petre."</p>

<p>"We want her in England for the attempted
murder of Mr. Royle," Edwards remarked. "I'll
apply for her extradition to-morrow. Your
chief will, no doubt, decide to keep Cane here&mdash;at
least, for the present. We shall want him
for the murder of the Englishman, Sir Digby
Kemsley."</p>

<p>"You may want me," laughed the culprit with
an air of supreme defiance, "but you'll never have
me! Oh, no, no! I'll remain over here, and leave
you wanting me."</p>

<p>"Prisoner, what is the use of these denials and
this defiance?" asked Fr&eacute;my severely in French,
advancing towards him. "You are in my custody&mdash;and
under the law of the Kingdom of Belgium I
arrest you for the murder of Sir Digby Kemsley,
in Peru, and for the murder of Stephanie, daughter
of his Highness the Grand Duke of Luxemburg."
Then, turning to his two subordinates, he added
briefly: "Put the handcuffs on him! He may give
trouble!"</p>

<p>"Handcuffs! Ha, ha!" cried Senos the Peruvian,
laughing and snapping his brown fingers in the
prisoner's face. "It is my triumph now. Senos
has avenged the death of his poor, good master!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"A moment," exclaimed the prisoner. "I may
at least be permitted to secure my papers before I
leave here, and hand them over to you? They will,
perhaps, interest you," he said quite coolly. Then
he took from his watch-chain a small key, and
with it opened a little cupboard in the wall, from
whence he took a small, square deed-box of
japanned tin, which he placed upon the table
before us.</p>

<p>With another and smaller key, and with a slight
grin upon his face, he opened the lid, but a cry of
dismay escaped us, for next second we saw that he
held in his hand a small, black object, sinuous and
writhing&mdash;a small, thin, but highly venomous black
snake!</p>

<p>It was over in an instant, ere we could realise
the truth. Upon his white wrist I saw a tiny bead
of blood, where the reptile had struck and bitten
him, and as he flung it back into the box and
banged down the lid he turned upon us in defiance,
and said:</p>

<p>"Now take me! I am ready," he cried, uttering
a peal of fiendish laughter. "Carry me where
you will, for in a few moments I shall be dead.
Ah! yes, my good friends! I have played the
great game&mdash;and lost. Yet I've cheated you all,
as I always declared that I would."</p>

<p>The two men sprang forward to slip the metal
gyves upon his wrists, but Fr&eacute;my, noticing the instant
change in the assassin's countenance, motioned
them off.</p>

<p>The culprit's face grew ashen grey, his thin
jaws were fixed. He tried to utter some further
words, but no sound came from him, only a low
gurgle.</p>

<p>We stood by and watched. He placed both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
his palms to his brow and stood for a few seconds
in the centre of the room. Then a paroxysm of pain
seemed to double him completely up, and he fell
to the carpet writhing in most fearful agony. It
was horrible to witness, and Phrida, with a cry,
turned away.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he lay stiff, and stretched his
limbs to such an extent that we could hear the bones
crack. His back became arched, and then he
expired with horrible convulsions, which held his
limbs stiffened and extended to their utmost limits&mdash;truly,
the most awful and agonising of deaths,
and a torture in the last moments that must have
been excruciating&mdash;a punishment worse, indeed,
than any that man-made law might allow.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As Herbert Cane paid the penalty of his
crimes the woman Petre at last recovered consciousness.</p>

<p>I saw the look of abject terror upon her face
as her eyes fell upon the man lying dead upon the
carpet before us.</p>

<p>She realised the terrible truth at once, and giving
vent to a loud, hysterical scream, rose and threw
herself on her knees beside the man whose wide-open
eyes, staring into space, were fast glazing
in death.</p>

<p>Edwards bent, and asked in a low voice whether
I wished to give her into custody for the attempt
upon me.</p>

<p>But I replied in the negative.</p>

<p>"The assassin has received his just punishment
and must answer to his Maker," I replied. "That
is enough. This scene will assuredly be a lesson
to her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"She falsely accused Miss Shand, remember,"
he said. "She knew all the time that Cane struck
the poor girl down."</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "Now that the stigma has been
removed from the one I love, I will be generous.
I will prefer no charge against her."</p>

<p>"Ah! dearest," cried Phrida, "I am glad of that.
Let us forgive, and endeavour, if possible, to forget
these dark, black days and weeks when both our
lives were blighted, and the future seemed so hopeless
and full of tragedy."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "let us go forth and forget."</p>

<p>And with a last glance at the dead man, with
the woman with dishevelled hair kneeling in despair
at his side, I took the arm of my beloved,
and kissing her before them all, led her out, away
from the scene so full of bitterness and horror.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To further prolong the relation of this tragic
chapter of my life's history would serve no
purpose.</p>

<p>What more need I tell you than to say Mrs.
Petre disappeared entirely, apparently thankful
to escape, and that at St. Mary Abbots, in Kensington,
a month ago, Phrida and I became
man and wife, both Edwards and Fr&eacute;my being
present.</p>

<p>As I pen these final lines I am sitting upon the
balcony of the great Winter Palace Hotel, in Luxor,
within sight of the colossal ruins of Karnak, for
we are spending a delightful honeymoon in Upper
Egypt, that region where the sun always shines
and rain never falls. Phrida, in her thin white
cotton gown and white sun helmet, though it is
January, is seated beside me, her little hand in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
mine. Below us, in the great garden, rise the high,
feathery palms, above a riot of roses and poinsettias,
magnolias, and other sweet-smelling flowers.</p>

<p>It is the silent, breathless hour of the desert sunset.
Before us, away beyond the little strip of
vegetation watered by the broad, ever-flowing Nile,
the clear, pale green sky is aflame with crimson,
a sunset mystic and wonderful, such as one only
sees in Egypt, that golden land of the long-forgotten.</p>

<p>From somewhere behind comes up the long-drawn
nasal song of an Arab boatman&mdash;that quaint,
plaintive, sing-song rhythm accompanied by a
tom-tom, which encourages the rowers to bend
at their oars, while away still further behind across
the river, lays the desolate ruins of the once-powerful
Thebes, and that weird, arid wilderness which is so
impressive&mdash;the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings.</p>

<p>Phrida has been reading what I have here written,
and as I kiss her sweet lips, she looks lovingly into
my eyes and says:</p>

<p>"It is enough, dearest. Say that you and I
are happy&mdash;ah! so supremely happy at last, in
each other's love. No pair in the whole world
could trust each other as we have done. I know
that I was guilty of a very grave fault&mdash;the fault
of concealing my friendship with that man from
you. But I foolishly thought I was acting in your
interests&mdash;that being your friend, he was mine also.
I never dreamed that such a refined face could hide
so black and vile a heart."</p>

<p>"But I have forgiven all, darling," I hasten to
reassure her! "I know now what a clever and
ingenious scoundrel that man was, and how full
of resource and amazing cunning. You were his
victim, just as I was myself&mdash;just as were the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
"No," I add, "life, love, and happiness are before us.
So let us learn to forget."</p>

<p>And as our lips meet once again in a long, fond,
passionate caress, I lay down my pen in order to
press her more closely to my breast.</p>

<p>She is mine&mdash;my own beloved&mdash;mine for now and
evermore.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">Lonesome Heights</h3>

<h4>HALLIWELL SUTCLIFFE.</h4>
